Keywords: plumbing graph, 3-manifolds, graph manifolds

We implement the calculus described in [Neu1981]. The plumbing
construction creates a graph manifold (three dimensional) specified by a
plumbing graph. Each vertex of the graph specifies an S<sup>1</sup>-bundle over a
surface, and for each edge, the corresponding bundles are glued together
in a specific way. Each vertex is decorated by the Euler number of the
corresponding S<sup>1</sup>-bundle, the genus of the base of the fibration, and
the number of boundary components of the surface, r. Each edge is
decorated by +1 or -1, which specify different gluings.

The calculus of Neumann [Neu1981] consists of several operations, or
moves, which can be applied to a plumbing graph to get the same
manifold. The main result is that two graphs inducing homeomorphic (or,
equivalently, diffeomorphic) plumbed manifolds are related by a finite
sequence of these operations, or their inverses. Furthermore, each
equivalence class of graphs by these operations contains a unique
element, the minimal representative of this manifold, which can be
obtained from any representative by applying the moves while possible.

As a special case, the resolution graph of an isolated surface
singularity is a plumbing graph which describes the link of the
singularity. A plumbing graph is so obtained if and only if all genera
are positive, all edges are positive, and the associated intersection
matrix is negative definite.

Another case related to singularity theory: As proved by N\'emethi and
Szil\'ard [], the boundary of the Milnor fiber of a reduced hypersurface
singularity in complex 3-space is plumbed manifold.  These do not
necessarily have negative definite plumbing graphs, and may have
negative edges as well.

We implement a class PlumbingGraph which keeps track of the graph and
the associated data. This class has as functions all the moves
introduced by Neumann in [Neu1981], as well as checking all the
minimality steps, and a function which reduces the graph to its minimal
representative (so far, the function which reduces the graph to its
minimal representative is not implemented, but it's being worked on). In
the future, we should also implement a class which is associated with
the graph a multiplicity system for a plumbing graph, as this allows for
a lot of constructions, such as computing resolution graphs for
susupension singularities, and the boundary of Milnor fibers in some
special cases.

The doc is not formatted correctly

typically, instead of

```
+        EXAMPLES::
+
+        We test all the examples on p. 315 of [Neu1981].
+
+        The first example, only one vertex:
+
+            sage: P = PlumbingGraph()
```
the double colon after EXAMPLES should be a single one, and the single colon after vertex should be a double one. Double colons should be followed by an indented block.

* one typo:

```
+        EXAPMLES::
```

* The first verb in any documentation string should be in imperative mode (no final s), for example: Check, Return, Compute, etc

* typos "apprears", chechs"

* this could be written in one line

```
+        if self.N6_c_find_candidate() == -1:
+            return False
+        else:
+            return True
```
could be

```
return self.N6_c_find_candidate() != -1
```
and then the method itself becomes rather useless..

* calls to references take a final underscore: `[Neu1981]_`

* This

```
+        if len(L) == 0:
```
could be `if not L:`

* typo `realation`

I will go through everything with your comments in mind soon. Some questions:

The functions genus_hash and big_genus_hash are used inside some functions in PlumbingGraph, and so if I change the line in all.py so that it only imports PlumbingGraph, then running ./sage -t gives errors. What line should I put in all.py so that 'correct' things are imported?

Do you know a good reference for where these double colons are explained in details? I'm really just imitating other code, I haven't found the actual protocols for this.

Also, if it makes sense, I'll add a line to src/doc/en/reference/discrete_geometry/index.rst in order to make the documentation get built. I'm getting errors now, so I'll have something to work on. I'll get on it and push something later today.

Hi Baldur, I didn't know that you were working on this, it is a nice addition. 

Did you consider inheriting from graph (I think it would make sense since plumbing graphs are basically graphs with some extra decoration, but maybe that would be too much overhead). That way, for example, you would have methods to compute connectivity invariants, or to plot them, for free.

{
    "body": "Hi Miguel,\n\nI first used the graph class to encode the graph, but the problem I ran into is that in that class, you have vertices enumerated by a list, but the edges are just specified by the associated vertices. It feels a lot more natural to me to have a list of vertices, a list of edges, and a set of adjacent vertices associated with each edge. This way you can add and delete edges in a way that feels more natural.\n\nMore importantly, if you have an actual set of edges, you can define functions on that set, such as the plus/minus decoration.

Hi Miguel,

I first used the graph class to encode the graph, but the problem I ran into is that in that class, you have vertices enumerated by a list, but the edges are just specified by the associated vertices. It feels a lot more natural to me to have a list of vertices, a list of edges, and a set of adjacent vertices associated with each edge. This way you can add and delete edges in a way that feels more natural.

More importantly, if you have an actual set of edges, you can define functions on that set, such as the plus/minus decoration. In further development, this kind of decorations will probably show up more and more, especially in algorithms translating one graph to another, such as between plumbing and splice graphs. Therefore, I would not like to express the +/- decorations by specifying the number of positive and number of negative edges joining any given pair of vertices, it seems that the code for that would be incomprehensible.

If anybody knows of a standard way to specify a function on the set of edges of a graph (using the graph class), let me know, it would probably be better, since you have all those graph theoretic functions for free. But this would mean that the graph class held on to an actual list of named edges, like it does for vertices, and it doesn't seem to me that this is the case.

If you have specific plumbing related algorithms in mind, let me know (or you can implement them when you want :). I thought about a few things to do with this, such as Oka's algorithm for Newton non-degenerate surface singularities, the splice-quotient construction, the zeta function of Némethi or Campillo-Delgado-Gusein-Zade. There are also some algorithms that compute the boundary of the Milnor fiber of a nonisolated hypersurface. I haven't started these, but they will each get a ticket in good time.

Thank you for updating this. A few things from a quick look-through:

- For the `INPUT:`, your input lines should not end in a period/full-stop.
- In `reverse_edge_signs_neg`, do you want to raise an error instead of just printing a message?
- Error messages should start with a lowercase and have no period. This is a Python convention we try to follow.
- I would rename `move_R` to `R_move` as it feels like a more natural name. What does the boolean output mean as well?
- You have a comment to address around `export_to_graph()`.
- `add_Seifert` -> `add_seifert` following PEP8 method naming conventions.
- I would have `PlumbingGraph` inherit from `SageObject`, which you can then rename `__repr__` -> `_repr_`.
- I would make the `step_X()` methods private `_step_X()` since they seem internal to a longer computation.
- Similar for the `N6_*` methods (although perhaps not all of them).
- Please update the documentation of `N4()` to be more formal.
- For some of the `NX()` methods, perhaps you could add an extra option to return a certificate of success/failure (where appropriate).
- Similar for `normal_form()`, where a success should be `0` and a failure should be a positive number. (This is similar to how string comparisons work in C code.) This method name needs to be changed irregardless as I would expect it to return (or put the graph into) a normal form.
- In `minimal_representative_analytic()`, it should raise a `TypeError` rather than an assert for an invalid operation.
- Add some latex formatting to the class-level doc, mainly ``S^1``.
- `[big_]genius_hash` should not be imported into the global namespace.

I might have more comments after a more serious (re-)reading.

Thanks a lot for the feedback, tscrim. This is very useful, since my background in programming is very informal. I will put some time into this, hopefully no later than this weekend, to go through this. Some quick comments:

- About the `export_to_graph()` function, I implemented this, but then the tests started to complain that loading the code was too slow, if I included the `Graph()` class. I got lost in trying to use the `Graph()` class, which includes all kinds of functions, which was one of the reasons I didn't use it in the first place.

- About the step_X() functions, I feel like it would be worth it to have these available, since they are explicitly described in Neumann's article. I can imagine it being useful for my research to be able to see the steps explicitly, if not just to understand the article better.

Just standard Python inheritance. So

class PlumbingGraph(SageObject):

Replying to [comment:69 tscrim]:

Thanks again for the comments, I have now gone through them more 
carefully.

> Thank you for updating this. A few things from a quick look-through:

>
> - For the `INPUT:`, your input lines should not end in a period/full-stop.
 
I removed periods and also commas ',' from the end of any line in an
INPUT: block.

> - In `reverse_edge_signs_neg`, do you want to raise an error instead of just printing a message?
 
In `reverse_edge_signs_pos` and `reverse_edge_signs_pos` I added an
assert line.

Fixed case and periods in error messages.

> - I would rename `move_R` to `R_move` as it feels like a more natural name. What does the boolean output mean as well?
 
I renamed `move_R` -> `R_move`. Also, you mention the output of the
move functions. That was an early bad decision on my behalf. I changed
it so that the move functions don't return anything, but they have
assertions checking whether the input is good.

> - You have a comment to address around `export_to_graph()`.
 
I uncommented the export_to_graph function, since it should be useful.
I did have some problems with loading times, so I threw the `import`
statement into the function. If this is nonsense, I'll change this, or
just delete the function. It is in no way essential to the project,
but it could be useful to people.

> - `add_Seifert` -> `add_seifert` following PEP8 method naming conventions.
 
I lowered the case of Seifert appearing in function names, so
`add_seifert` and `seifert_graph_exchange`.

> - I would have `PlumbingGraph` inherit from `SageObject`, which you can then rename `__repr__` -> `_repr_`.
 
I made the class inherit from SageObject and renamed __repr__ to
_repr_.

> - I would make the `step_X()` methods private `_step_X()` since they seem internal to a longer computation.

My intention was, and is, to implement Neumann's calculus described in
[Neu1981]. I feel like this project would be incomplete without these
functions available, since they are explicitly described in the article.

> - Please update the documentation of `N4()` to be more formal.
 
The documentation for `N4()` has been formalised, I think it's better.

> - For some of the `NX()` methods, perhaps you could add an extra option to return a certificate of success/failure (where appropriate).
 
Right. I don't really know what would be the best way to implement
something like that.

> - Similar for `normal_form()`, where a success should be `0` and a failure should be a positive number. (This is similar to how string comparisons work in C code.) This method name needs to be changed irregardless as I would expect it to return (or put the graph into) a normal form.


Again, I'm not sure how to implement the communication of such data.

I made the following changes, I think it's more consistent:

- `normal_form()` -> `is_normal()` since this function checks whether
   the graph is in normal form.

- `minimal_representative()` -> `make_normal()` since this function
  makes the graph normal.

- `is_analytic_link()` -> `is_good_resolution()` since this function checks
  whether the graph comes directly from a good resolution. An analytic
  link can be represented by a graph which is not like that.

- `minimal_representative_analytic()` ->
  `make_minimal_good_resolution()` since this function takes a
  good resolution graph and finds the corresponding minimal good
  resolution graph.


> - In `minimal_representative_analytic()`, it should raise a `TypeError` rather than an assert for an invalid operation.
 
I put in a check that raises a `TypeError` if the graph is not a good
resolution graph.

> - Add some latex formatting to the class-level doc, mainly ``S^1``.
 
Added it. I also went quickly through all the documentation and added
quotes to some places.

> - `[big_]genius_hash` should not be imported into the global namespace.
 
Removed the genus hash functions from src/sage/geometry/all.py. Now it
has to be imported to be used.

That's great, thanks :)
