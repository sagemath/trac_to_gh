FWIW this is the commit that breaks it

https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/code/ci/801a0bb782fd09b9907a599541e1bff622ea453d

I can't decrypt what it means though, or why it breaks this test in sage but not in maxima itself.

Regarding integrals of abs(sin(x)) and related, see

- https://trac.sagemath.org/query?order=id&desc=1&summary=~abs(sin

To explore anything to do with Maxima, it's important to remember
that Sage starts Maxima by setting some defaults including `domain : complex`
and loading some packages including `abs_integrate`, leading to differences
with running Maxima on its own.

See [lines 171 to 173 in src/sage/interfaces/maxima_lib.py](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/6187d261eca3c980e575b53d1a31f580ba8cfdfd/src/sage/interfaces/maxima_lib.py#L171)

```
init_code = ['besselexpand : true', 'display2d : false',
            'domain : complex', 'keepfloat : true',
            'load(to_poly_solve)', 'load(simplify_sum)',
            'load(abs_integrate)', 'load(diag)']
```


Bugs in Maxima can be discussed on the maxima-discuss mailing list,
always recalling these specifics of running Maxima in Sage.
