A lot of reviewer commits added. Need a cross review; but positive review from my side (so far).

I've cross-reviewed your cleanup (thanks!) and implemented the higher-level functions in the ring. Basically, everything exp/log-related **should** work now.

Does not merge with 6.9.rc0.

I guess that `exp` and `log` will both need modifications once `L`-terms are implemented (appropriate truncated Taylor series will be needed in the asymptotic ring); this should be mentioned in a TODO.

There is one follow-up ticket: #19316 compute asymptotic expansion to some rational directly

I review this ticket and the follow-up-ticket #19083 in one go, as there are many interdependencies.


---

Comment by cheuberg created at 2015-10-16 10:44:38

As this is reviewed in #19083, it seems best to close this as a duplicate.
