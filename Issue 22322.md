Patchbot is not smart enough to recognize the six before iteritems.

I changed it to just `iteritems` in bipartite_graph.py, but the way I had it before is exactly how it was used in graph.py. I didn't fix it in graph.py since it's not broken.

Well... actually, there is a another issue with the wikipedia link. Sorry.

This

```
        For more information, see the `Wikipedia article on matchings
        :wikipedia:`Matching_(graph_theory)`
```
produces something like `For more information, see the Wikipediaarticleonmatchings:wikipedia:‘Matching(graphtheory)`. Check the html.

So you should write

```
        For more information, see :wikipedia:`Matching_(graph_theory)`
```
or even better

```

        - :wikipedia:`Matching_(graph_theory)`

Sorry I did not pass tests on the full library when reviewing this ticket. 


One solution is to set the algorithm to `None` 

```
    def matching(self, value_only=False, algorithm=None,
                 use_edge_labels=False, solver=None, verbose=0):
```
and then to add after `self._scream_if_not_simple()`:

```
        if algorithm is None:
            if use_edge_labels:
                algorithm = "Edmonds"
            else:
                algorithm = "Hopcroft-Karp"
```
You will have to update the documentation accordingly, for instance like 

```
        - ``algorithm`` -- string (default: ``"Hopcroft-Karp"`` if
          ``use_edge_labels==False``, otherwise ``"Edmonds"``)

``` 

and add a tests on a weighted graph like:

```
sage: G = graphs.CycleGraph(4)
sage: B = BipartiteGraph([(u,v,2) for u,v in G.edges(labels=0)])
sage: B.matching(use_edge_labels=True)
[(0, 3, 2), (1, 2, 2)]
sage: B.matching(use_edge_labels=True, value_only=True)
4
sage: B.matching(use_edge_labels=True, value_only=True, algorithm='Edmonds')
4
sage: B.matching(use_edge_labels=True, value_only=True, algorithm='LP')
4.0
sage: B.matching(use_edge_labels=True, value_only=True, algorithm='Eppstein')
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: use_edge_labels can not be used with Hopcroft-Karp or Eppstein
sage: B.matching(use_edge_labels=True, value_only=True, algorithm='Hopcroft-Karp')
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: use_edge_labels can not be used with Hopcroft-Karp or Eppstein
sage: B.matching(use_edge_labels=False, value_only=True, algorithm='Hopcroft-Karp')
2
sage: B.matching(use_edge_labels=False, value_only=True, algorithm='Eppstein')
2
sage: B.matching(use_edge_labels=False, value_only=True, algorithm='Edmonds')
2
sage: B.matching(use_edge_labels=False, value_only=True, algorithm='LP')
2
```

I had to create a new branch since I cannot push in branch `u/zgershkoff/matchings_in_bipartite_graphs`. The new branch is in `public/`, so you can push commits as well.

Bipartite graphs are used in the following modules. The new branch passes all tests (on my computer), but it's better to double check (as well as docbuild, etc.).

```
src/sage/combinat/
src/sage/game_theory/
src/sage/graphs/
src/sage/groups/
src/sage/matrix/
src/sage/matroids/
```

Let's hope this ticket will soon be finalized ;)

That is the correct behavior and the correct thing to do.

LGTM too. Thanks.
