tldr: Bernoulli(250408) has a million digit denominator whose value differs by 1428094259 from the correct value.

One has

```
sage: %time bflint = bernoulli(250408, algorithm='flint')
CPU times: user 9.86 s, sys: 49.9 ms, total: 9.91 s
Wall time: 9.95 s
sage: %time barb = bernoulli(250408, algorithm='arb')
CPU times: user 10.2 s, sys: 23.9 ms, total: 10.2 s
Wall time: 10.3 s
sage: %time bpari = bernoulli(250408, algorithm='pari')
CPU times: user 11.6 s, sys: 36.9 ms, total: 11.7 s
Wall time: 11.7 s
sage: %time bbernmm = bernoulli(250408, algorithm='bernmm')
CPU times: user 13.3 s, sys: 0 ns, total: 13.3 s
Wall time: 13.3 s
```
And pari/arb/bernmm agrees on the answer (and disagree with flint)

```
sage: bbernmm == barb == bpari
True
sage: barb == bflint
False
```

Fredrik Johansson advises to switch to Arb for computing Bernoulli numbers because of https://github.com/wbhart/flint2/issues/288

This ticket modifies the default so that flint is used in small range, arb in intermediate range and bernmm in large range. The choice `algorithm=flint` with large input generates a warning. With the branch applied

```
sage: bernoulli(250408) == bernoulli(250408, algorithm='bernmm')
True
sage: b = bernoulli(250408, algorithm='flint')
.../sage/arith/misc.py:368: UserWarning: flint is known to not be accurate for large Bernoulli numbers

We may temporarily just do what the reporter on sage-devel did, i.e., change the "algorithm" used (perhaps depending on the argument):

```
Since Sage uses flint as the default algorithm for n<=300000 the error
affects Sage and can be observed, e.g., by comparing
bernoulli(250408,'flint') and bernoulli(250408,'bernmm').
```
(Just noticed `algorithm="arb"` is also already supported; there are various backends.)

Or apply the upstream fix...

All values n <= 20000 currently used in the thresholds have been tested one by one. So that there is a guarantee (until we upgrade flint :-).
