We may temporarily just do what the reporter on sage-devel did, i.e., change the "algorithm" used (perhaps depending on the argument):

```
Since Sage uses flint as the default algorithm for n<=300000 the error
affects Sage and can be observed, e.g., by comparing
bernoulli(250408,'flint') and bernoulli(250408,'bernmm').
```

(Just noticed `algorithm="arb"` is also already supported; there are various backends.)

Or apply the upstream fix...

Note the flint fix does not guarantee anything. It should fix the problem for all practical sizes, but there are no proven bounds. Arb guarantees the correct result up to bugs.

All values n <= 20000 currently used in the thresholds have been tested one by one. So that there is a guarantee (until we upgrade flint :-).
