Well, technically the shuffle algebra should be in the category of commutative Hopf algebras, so it might be better to use the category of `Bialgebras(R).Commutative()`. However, the antipode is easy to implement: reverse the order of the `n` letters times (-1)<sup>n</sup> (see [this MathOverflow post](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/63923/shuffle-hopf-algebra-how-to-prove-its-properties-in-a-slick-way)). So I would propose changing the category to `HopfAlgebras(R).Commutative()` and adding

```python
def antipode_on_basis(self, w):
    """
    Return the antipode on the basis element ``w``.
    """
    mone = -self.base_ring().one()
    return self.term(w.reversal(), mone**len(w))
```

along with in the dual PBW basis

```python
def antipode(self, elt):
    """
    Return the antipode of the element ``elt``.
    """
    return self(self.expansion(elt).antipode())
```
