# Issue 15887: dev scripts can not handle merged tickets

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16124

Merging dependencies fails when one of the tickets has already been merged. In
this case the branch field of the ticket does not contain an actual branch but
a commit hash.

Changing status from new to needs_review.

It is an intentional feature that you cannot download arbitrary commits (define by SHA1) from remote git servers. Only named branches can be fetched.

I hope you don't mind that I revert your change. But I do not think that the discussion about the dev scripts removal has reached a conclusion yet.
