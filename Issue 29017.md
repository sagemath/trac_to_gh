# Issue 29017: wrong/misleading error message using MixedIntegerLinearProgram/GLPK

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29254

Original creator: galipnik

Original creation time: 2020-02-27 17:25:54

The following code leads to an error message which seems to be incorrect (or *at least misleading*...): "MIPSolverException: GLPK: Problem has no feasible solution".

- The MILP has a feasible solution, at least the zero vector is feasible.
- If I set `x.set_max(10^5)` (something smaller than `10^20`), everything works fine. 



```

sage: P = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(maximization=True, solver="GLPK")
sage: x = P.new_variable(integer=True, nonnegative=True)
sage: x.set_max(10^25)
sage: P.set_objective(sum(x[i] for i in srange(25)))
sage: for i in srange(14):
....:     P.add_constraint(sum(x[j]*A[i][j] for j in srange(20)) == 0)
sage: P.solve()
```


The line of code where the error message comes from is line 1076 in `glpk_backend.pyx` (observe `unknown error during call to GLPK`):


```
-> 1076 raise MIPSolverException("GLPK: "+solution_status_msg.get(solution_status, "unknown error during call to GLPK : "+str(solution_status)))
```

Same issue with cplex and gurobi. However, with PPL, we get the solution `160000000000000000000000000`. I don't know were the problem comes from.

Moving tickets to milestone sage-9.2 based on a review of last modification date, branch status, and severity.

Setting new milestone based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.
