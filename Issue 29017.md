The following code leads to an error message which seems to be incorrect (or *at least misleading*...): "MIPSolverException: GLPK: Problem has no feasible solution".

- The MILP has a feasible solution, at least the zero vector is feasible.
- If I set `x.set_max(10^5)` (something smaller than `10^20`), everything works fine.

The line of code where the error message comes from is line 1076 in `glpk_backend.pyx` (observe `unknown error during call to GLPK`):


```
-> 1076 raise MIPSolverException("GLPK: "+solution_status_msg.get(solution_status, "unknown error during call to GLPK : "+str(solution_status)))
```
