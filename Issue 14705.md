It seems that a number of packages fail to load, possibly for similar reasons.  Perhaps the people from #14682 know how to fix this:



```
sage: optional_packages()[0]
['database_gap-4.6.4', 'gap_packages-4.6.4']
sage: version()
'Sage Version 5.11.beta3, Release Date: 2013-06-21'
```



```
sage: gap_package_names = ['braid','crime','cryst','ctbllib','design','factint','gapdoc','grape','guava','hap','hapcryst','happrime','laguna','polymake','sonata','toric']

sage: for name in gap_package_names:
    stat = gap('LoadPackage("{0}")'.format(name))
    prefix = ' ' if str(stat) == 'true' else 'x'
    print("{2} : {0: <8} got '{1}' when loading.".format(name,stat,prefix))
....:     

  : braid    got 'true' when loading.
  : crime    got 'true' when loading.
x : cryst    got 'fail' when loading.
  : ctbllib  got 'true' when loading.
  : design   got 'true' when loading.
  : factint  got 'true' when loading.
  : gapdoc   got 'true' when loading.
  : grape    got 'true' when loading.
  : guava    got 'true' when loading.
x : hap      got 'fail' when loading.
x : hapcryst got 'fail' when loading.
x : happrime got 'fail' when loading.
  : laguna   got 'true' when loading.
x : polymake got 'fail' when loading.
  : sonata   got 'true' when loading.
  : toric    got 'true' when loading.

```


This leads to a number of failing doctests:


```
$ ./sage -t --optional=gap_packages devel/sage/sage

----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t devel/sage/sage/coding/linear_code.py  # 12 doctests failed
sage -t devel/sage/sage/combinat/designs/incidence_structures.py  # 2 doctests failed
sage -t devel/sage/sage/combinat/designs/design_catalog.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t devel/sage/sage/groups/perm_gps/permgroup.py  # 19 doctests failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Fixed by adding missing dependency packages. Will upload spkg tomorrow. 

Also, HAPprime was never included, fixed in the docs. 

The packages cryst isn't included and therefore HAPcryst can't work. I'll leave this for later.

    x : HAPcryst   got 'fail' when loading.       
```


In fact, maybe I have attached a git branch with this version of the test! (Still figuring out the git workflow . . .)


And another issue:  Why do we have 


```
$ ./sage -t --optional=sage,gap_packages src/sage/tests/gap_packages.py 
Running doctests with ID 2013-07-19-15-20-57-fee4b5ac.
...
Total time for all tests: 7.3 seconds
    cpu time: 7.2 seconds
    cumulative wall time: 7.2 seconds
```


and


```
sage: %time import sage.tests.gap_packages
CPU times: user 5.55 s, sys: 0.05 s, total: 5.61 s
Wall time: 5.61 s
```


The rest of the things in sage/tests seem to import instantly . . . is there something I'm doing wrong which makes this one so slow?

Indeed, I have verified that all of the import time comes from importing libgap.  The new version of the patch looks good, and in particular the new test for loading packages is much better.

Now checking (long) doctests, I find failures in 3 files:


```
----------------------------------------------------------------------
sage -t --long sage/combinat/designs/incidence_structures.py  # 2 doctests failed
sage -t --long sage/combinat/designs/design_catalog.py  # 1 doctest failed
sage -t --long sage/coding/linear_code.py  # 8 doctests failed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
```



The first two seem to be introduced by #14499; fixing these is now #14950




The failures in coding/linear_code are all in optional `gap_packages` doctests, and they all have to do with the GUAVA package.  My guess is that these come from a version change or something similar, because guava does load, and some guava-dependent doctests do work, such as


```
sage: C = HammingCode(5,GF(2))
sage: C.covering_radius()  # optional - gap_packages (Guava package)
1
```



```
sage: C = HammingCode(3,GF(2))
sage: MS = MatrixSpace(GF(2),1,7)
sage: F = GF(2); a = F.gen()
sage: v1 = [a,a,F(0),a,a,F(0),a]
sage: C.decode(v1,algorithm="guava")  # optional - gap_packages (Guava package)
```


One failure comes from 


```
sage: print bounds_minimum_distance(10,5,GF(2)) # optional - gap_packages (Guava package)
```


This seems to give the same record as expected (see [here](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/coding/sage/coding/linear_code.html#sage.coding.linear_code.bounds_minimum_distance)), but the entries aren't printed in the correct order, hence causing a doctest failure.


Another failure comes from 


```
sage: MS = MatrixSpace(GF(2),4,7)
sage: G = MS([[1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,0,0,1,1,0,0],[0,1,0,1,0,1,0],[1,1,0,1,0,0,1]])
sage: C = LinearCode(G)
sage: C.spectrum()
[1, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 1]
sage: C.spectrum(algorithm="leon")     # optional - gap_packages (Guava package)
sh: /home/johnson.5320/sage/local/gap/latest/pkg/guava-3.12/bin/wtdist: No such file or directory
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
RuntimeError                              Traceback (most recent call last)
...
RuntimeError: Problem calling Leon's wtdist program. Install gap_packages*.spkg and run './configure ../..; make'.
```


For this last error, I see that the file 

`SAGE_ROOT/local/gap/latest/pkg/guava-3.12/bin/wtdist` 

does not exist, but  

`SAGE_ROOT/local/gap/latest/pkg/guava-3.12/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc-default64/wtdist` 

does exist.  So probably this is an error coming from rearranging files.  I haven't checked the other failures here; I am inclined to believe that fixing them belongs on a new ticket, but I'm not sure.

I've fixed the guava package path and the trivial failures. There are still three failures in linear_code.py with guava that seem to be bugs in guava. For all of them we have native code that does the same, only the optional guava-based implementation fails. Needs to be debugged further by somebody else.

is this a libgap-related issue? I'm not aware of guava bugs in the "main" Sage code.
