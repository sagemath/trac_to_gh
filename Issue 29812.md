# Issue 29812: Add sage.numerical.backends.matrix_sdp_backend (dummy SDP solver)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30049

Original creator: mkoeppe

Original creation time: 2020-07-02 19:36:50

We add a class `MatrixSDPBackend`, subclassing `GenericSDPBackend`, which stores the SDP data in Sage matrices.

It will allow users to specify a base ring and thus store exact SDPs. This is similar to what `InteractiveLPBackend` provides for LPs.

Attempting to solve it will give a runtime error.

patchbot complains about extra space before final `:` 

```
inside file:  b/src/sage/numerical/backends/matrix_sdp_backend.pyx
@@ -0,0 +1,485 @@
+        - ``sense`` (integer) :
```

this seems to be OK, though, as docs still build.
Can you just remove ` ``  :` there?
