# Issue 8797: add symbolic logic to the reference manual

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/8797

Original creator: mvngu

Original creation time: 2010-04-28 06:57:11

Assignee: mvngu

As the subject says. Currently, the modules under `sage/logic/` are not in the reference manual. Clean up the documentation of all modules under `sage/logic/` and get those modules in the reference manual. But before adding them to the reference manual, first we need to clean up their documentation. This clean-up task is spread across the following tickets:

 * #8790 --- improve doctest coverage of logic/logic.py
 * #8792 --- clean up documentation of logic/booleval.py
 * #8793 --- clean up documentation of logic/boolformula.py
 * #8794 --- clean up documentation of logic/logicparser.py
 * #8795 --- clean up documentation of logic/logictable.py
 * #8796 --- clean up documentation of logic/propcalc.py
