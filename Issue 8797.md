As the subject says. Currently, the modules under `sage/logic/` are not in the reference manual. Clean up the documentation of all modules under `sage/logic/` and get those modules in the reference manual.

* #8790 --- improve doctest coverage of logic/logic.py
* #8792 --- clean up documentation of logic/booleval.py
* #8793 --- clean up documentation of logic/boolformula.py
