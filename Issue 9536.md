Hi,
several packages do use `python setup.py`. This picks up the customized settings from ~/.pydistutils.cfg. This is bad, because it overrides the prefix setting. 

For sage-main, I'll attach a patch: `setup.cfg` in the corresponding directory overrides the usere settings. Maybe there's a global solution.

Regards,
  Alexander Dreyer

Hi,
I backported the handling of setup.py --no-user-cfg from  Python 2.7 to Python 2.6.4 and also added the handling of the environment variable `DISTUTILS_NO_USER_CFG` to python's distutils. 

The new spkg can be found here: 
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/dreyer/suse101/python-2.6.4.p10.spkg

The last patch adds this variable to `sage-env`.

Regards,
  Alexander

You should also create patches/ACKS.txt.diff as a unified diff file. Although its fairly obvious you can recreate that now, that will not be the case if Python source code is updated. 

Would a simpler solution not be for sage-env to set this variable and export it? I don't know much about python, so can't review this myself.
