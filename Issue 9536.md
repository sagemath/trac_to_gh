# Issue 9536: python setup.py picks prefix from ~/.pydistutils.cfg

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/9536

Original creator: AlexanderDreyer

Original creation time: 2010-07-18 14:07:14

Hi,
several packages do use `python setup.py`. This picks up the customized settings from ~/.pydistutils.cfg. This is bad, because it overrides the prefix setting. 

For sage-main, I'll attach a patch: `setup.cfg` in the corresponding directory overrides the usere settings. Maybe there's a global solution.

Regards,
  Alexander Dreyer

The following packages from the distribution use setup.py and may be affected:

```
zodb3-3.7.0.p4
scipy_sandbox-20071020.p5
pexpect-2.0.p4
sqlalchemy-0.5.8
glpk-4.44
mpmath-0.15
pil-1.1.6.p2
mercurial-1.3.1.p2
pycrypto-2.0.1.p5
mpir-1.2.2.p1
weave-0.4.9.p0
sympy-0.6.4.p0
scons-1.2.0

Hi!
I am not an export for that for that, but did you read
http://docs.python.org/install/#location-and-names-of-config-files
There seems to be some options:
â€“no-user-cfg

Cheers,
Michael

Comment by AlexanderDreyer created at 2010-07-19 10:13:22

Hi Michael,
indeed, that's a better solution. But both have the problem, that 30+ packages would have to be fixed, and it might be forgotten in the future. (Maybe there some monkey patch for distutils, that all of it can be overwritten by the environment.)

Best regards,
  Alexander

Comment by PolyBoRi created at 2010-07-19 10:23:03

maybe, I did not try (just read the docs):
http://docs.python.org/install/#inst-config-files

create system distutils.cfg


```
[global]
no-user-cfg=1
```



---

Comment by AlexanderDreyer created at 2010-07-19 15:11:54

Hi,
unfortunately, this is a Python 2.7 feature and it does not support no-user-cfg in distutils.cfg :-(

Regards,
  Alexander

patch for sage/spkg/base/sage-env sage/local/bin/sage-env (needs python 2.6.4.p10)

Hi,
I backported the handling of setup.py --no-user-cfg from  Python 2.7 to Python 2.6.4 and also added the handling of the environment variable `DISTUTILS_NO_USER_CFG` to python's distutils. 

The new spkg can be found here: 
http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/dreyer/suse101/python-2.6.4.p10.spkg

The last patch adds this variable to `sage-env`.

Regards,
  Alexander

Replying to [comment:9 AlexanderDreyer]:
> Minor update: http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/dreyer/suse101/python-2.6.4.p10.spkg (useful, if the `sage-env` patch is not used)
You should also create patches/ACKS.txt.diff as a unified diff file. Although its fairly obvious you can recreate that now, that will not be the case if Python source code is updated. 

Would a simpler solution not be for sage-env to set this variable and export it? I don't know much about python, so can't review this myself.

Comment by AlexanderDreyer created at 2010-07-21 15:45:42

Maybe a misunderstanding: the patch of python is necessary  to fix that issue anyway. (This first variant didn't work, if the environment variable was _not_ set.)

The python community does not like the idea of adding an environment variable, see:

Needs a branch.  And we have updated Python.  And probably other reasons it isn't ready yet.  (Or conceivably has been solved in the meantime?)

I've created an upstream issue for this:
 https://github.com/zeromq/pyzmq/issues/937


---

Comment by embray created at 2016-11-10 11:42:15

That's annoying.  For now we should probably remove pip install from pyzmq.


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2016-11-10 18:11:49

Upstream pyzmq reports that it works with pip 9.0.1, setuptools 28.8.0.

Let's try with upgrading these packages. #21835 does the upgrade of pip to 9.0.0...


---

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2016-11-10 18:56:35

Upgrading setuptools to 28.8.0 does not fix the pyzmq install.

I'll wait for the pip upgrade.

Just a comment: it would make sense to use `$PIP_INSTALL` for a few more packages where no extra options are needed: `fpylll`, `gambit`, `sagenb`, `sagetex`.


---

I agree, but that should be on a different ticket. I've created #21864 for this.

Comment by embray created at 2017-01-17 12:06:23

The issue with `--global-option` and `--no-user-cfg` still seems odd to me. I think that should be considered a bug in pip.  But I guess there's nothing to be done for now.
