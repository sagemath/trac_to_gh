note that sage-env is not executable so you need to do 
 
   source sage-env

to test it.

This is also fixed by #5852, where the `SAGE_ROOT` detection is completely changed.

So personally, I prefer closing this as "duplicate".

Hej Jeroen,

I was just walking trough the open tickets I participated in. Are you still going to close this one as duplicate?
