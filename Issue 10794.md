This works.  I'm not quite sure why - is all R doc in UTF-8 now? maybe this happened with the last R upgrade - but it does.  

Positive review if we can't think of a way to doctest this.  Is this something we can doctest using `EMBEDDED_MODE`?  cc:ing in a few people who might know the answer to that question.

Apparently it is.

```
sage: a = r.lm
sage: b = a._sage_doc_()
sage: b[:150]
'lm                    package:stats                    R Documentation\n\n_\x08F_\x08i_\x08t_\x08t_\x08i_\x08n_\x08g _\x08L_\x08i_\x08n_\x08e_\x08a_\x08r _\x08M_\x08o_\x08d_\x08e_\x08l_\x08s\n\n_\x08D_\x08e_\x08s_\x08c_\x08r_\x08'

I've added a doctest for this.  There are warnings, but they are ok - I think they are just because of the R formatting.  Warnings of this type do not affect passing doctests.
