CC:  bouillaguet

Numpy and Scipy has functions to load matrix save in text files (Numpy: http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/routines.io.html and Scipy: http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/io.html).

Will be nice to have a Sage function to call some of this function as backend and to handle with more file formats.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13601

In the version 0.2 of the attachment:trac_13601-matrix_io.patch I make some improves in the definition of the functions and the documentation and write tests for all the functions.

IMHO, will be better to freeze this ticket and open others when write the not implemented functions.

IMHO, for the string to be parse it must be equal to the nice string representation of:

* a flat list of elements: `'[1, 2, 3, 4]'`;
* a list of lists (i.e., a list of rows): `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`;
* a list of Sage vectors: `'[(1, 2), (3, 4)]'`
* a dictionary having positions as keys and matrix entries as values: `'{(0, 1): 2, (1, 0): 3, (0, 0): 1, (1, 1): 4}'`

Once in all the four cases above the 0-position of the string is `[` or `{` it can be used to disambiguate between the two.

Will be good too that one could do

```
matrix("""
1, 2
3, 4
""")
```


For this special case we can use the new line character to disambiguate.

To parse a string-matrix I think we should just match numbers and strip everything else out, as in

```
sage: number = re.compile('[-+]?[0-9]*\.?[0-9]+([eE][-+]?[0-9]+)?')
sage: [ match.group() for match in number.finditer('[ 1e3, 0 | 3 6, 1.3 .123)') ]
['1e3', '0', '3', '6', '1.3', '.123']
```

Then put the numbers from each line into the rows of a matrix. This should grok all ascii-art matrix representations.

If the input string is already valid Python, say, then the user can just eval it directly. So we shouldn't worry too much about that case.

+1 to use `matrix.load()` to load the matrix.
