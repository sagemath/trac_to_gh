Hi Volker, I've done a few small changes: Mainly replaced `coeffs()` by `coefficients(sparse=False)` in a few doctests and made sure that the documentation builds.

On my computer the docs now build and the tests pass. If you're happy with my changes, then you can set it to positive review.

Looks good.

We have Sphinx configured to use both Dollar sign and single backtick for math mode, so its just a matter of taste which one you prefer.
