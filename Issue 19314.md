Keywords: product projective morphism

The following are simple bugs in projective product morphisms:


```
PP.<x,y,z,u,v,w>=ProductProjectiveSpaces(QQ,[1,1,1])
HP=End(PP)
f=HP([v*x^2,w*y^2,z^2,u^2,v^2,w^2])
Q=PP([0,1,1,1,1,0])
f(Q)
```



```
R.<s,t>=PolynomialRing(QQ)
Z.<a,b,x,y,z> = ProductProjectiveSpaces([1,2],QQ)
P.<u,v,w,s,t,r>=ProductProjectiveSpaces([3,1],QQ)
H =Hom(Z,P)
f = H([a^2,b^2,a^2,a*b,a*x,b*z])
```


the following should fail (not multihomogeneous) but passes

```
Z.<a,b,c,x,y,z> = ProductProjectiveSpaces([1,3],QQ)
P.<u,v,w,s,t,r>=ProductProjectiveSpaces([2,2],QQ)
H =Hom(Z,P)
f = H([a^2,b^2,c^2,x^2,y^2,z^2])
```

A couple comments:

- There is a test failure in morphism.py. That test is checking if the map is a non-morpism, but the map is actually poorly defined. So correct the map to still be a non-morphism, but a valid map.

- I think we need at least some basic input checking in __call__, e.g. that the codomain of the point is in the domain of the function, otherwise examples like the following are badly behaved:


```
PP.<t0,t1,t2,t3,t4>=ProductProjectiveSpaces([2,1],ZZ)
Q=PP([1,1,1,2,1])
Z.<a,b,x,y,z> = ProductProjectiveSpaces([1,2],ZZ)
H = End(Z)
f = H([a^3,b^3+a*b^2,x^2,y^2-z^2,z*y])
f(Q)
```


While we are fixing __call__, I think you should add a test for the parameter `check` as well, such as the following:


```
PP.<x,y,z,u,v,w,s,t>=ProductProjectiveSpaces(QQ,[3,3])
HP=End(PP)
g=HP([4*v*x^2,2*w*y^2,2*v*z^2,2*s*x*y,v^2,w^2,3*s*v,t^2])
P=PP([1,1,2,1,1,0,3,1])
g(P,check=False)
```
