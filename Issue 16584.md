I've reviewed most of the math and have done some testing here and there on this. It looks good from my perspective.

From what I recall there needs to be a second reviewer? If so, then I'll leave it open until there is a second reviewer to approve this.

No, Sage only requires one reviewer. So once you add your (real) name to the reviewers, you can set a positive review.

Neither the dependency #16820 nor latest develop merges cleanly with this branch.

Note that I'm not particularly interested in this ticket, I just randomly noticed this.

This just needs someone to check that nothing broke from my rebase.

Cleanly merges in Sage 7.6 + #16820 for me, + all doctests passed.

Can I treat that reset to positive review?

Edit - The patchbot failure is fixed by recent changes to #16820.

Looks good to me.
