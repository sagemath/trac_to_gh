Looks good overall, but I don't think your representation of C<sub>3</sub> on the exterior algebra has the group acting by ring automorphims. In particular, I would expect `g (x1 x2) = (g x1) (g x2) = x2 x0 = -x0 x2`, but your code yields `x0 x2`. First there is a more fundamental issue I had to fix:

```diff
-sage: on_basis = lambda g,m: E.monomial(tuple(g(i+1)-1 for i in m[0])) #cyclically permute generators
+sage: on_basis = lambda g,m: M.monomial(tuple(g(i+1)-1 for i in m)) #cyclically permute generators
```

then I get

```
sage: g = G.gen()
sage: r = R.an_element(); r
1 + 2*x0 + x0*x1 + 3*x1
sage: g * r
1 + 2*x1 + x1*x2 + 3*x2
sage: g^2 * r
1 + 3*x0 + 2*x2 + x2*x0
```

So a little more care is needed with this doctest.

Also, PEP8 spacing:

```diff
-sage: R = Representation(G, M, on_basis, category = Algebras(QQ).WithBasis().FiniteDimensional())
+sage: R = Representation(G, M, on_basis, category=Algebras(QQ).WithBasis().FiniteDimensional())
```

This change should be reverted for PEP8 spacing:

```diff
-            sage: R = Representation(G, A, action, 'left', category=category)
+            sage: R = Representation(G, A, action, 'left', category = category)
```

You can also simplify `tuple([g(j+1)-1])` -> `(g(j+1)-1,)`
