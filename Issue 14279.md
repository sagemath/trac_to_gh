Very short patch ! I met that problem while trying to run 

```
sage: sage.combinat.designs.block_design.WittDesign(24)
```

and I had no idea how to install a gap package in the copy of gap that Sage contains...

I also updated the spkg on the way.

This patch works for me, applied to sage 5.8:

` sage: sage.combinat.designs.block_design.WittDesign(24)`

`Incidence structure with 24 points and 759 block `

However, after being prompted to run install_package("gap_packages"), gap_packages-4.5.7 is found. After you updated the spkg was I supposed to find gap_packages-4.6.3 ?

Nononono, `gap` and `gap_packages` are different spkg. Besides, when you ask Sage to install a package for you it will download the latest "accepted" package, so not the one from this ticket `:-)`

I'm pretty sure the doctest will fail if you happen to have gap_packages installed (which includes HAP). How about we use `gap.load_package("foobar")` or something like that instead?

Such a doctest already exists in `interfaces/gap.py`. Do you think that we should remove this doctest from `permgroup.py` ? I think it make sense.

What do you think of this warning/exception thing ?

The doctest for the `load_package()` isn't necessary if it is tested elsewhere, but it is the natural place in the docstring to point out that you have to install HAP. I'll let you decide if you want to keep it or not.

As I said already, helpful explanations should be warnings not errors. The error message should be less than a whole line if possible. Advanced users shouldn't be drowned in paragraphs of text for simple errors. We could make warnings more prominent (say, using colors or bold text), but thats for another ticket.

Then I will probaly remove the doctest.

My problem with exceptions and warnings is not so general : in that case, a warning is printed just before the exception is raised, and no one sees the warning as a result. It would make more sense to just raise an exception. I will try to make the error message shorter.
