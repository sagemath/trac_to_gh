CC:  @mstreng @pjbruin

Keywords: invariant_theory

Implement a function that given a set of values of invariants of a binary quintic, finds a quintic that attains these values up to scaling. 

A general framework for reconstruction is implemented and the original invariant_theory module is moved to support this functionality.

This ticket requires binary quintics for computations and doctests, so depends on #25395.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25508
