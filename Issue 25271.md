# Issue 25271: Implement reconstruction of binary quintics

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jnoordsij

Original creation time: 2018-06-04 19:31:15

CC:  mstreng pbruin

Keywords: invariant_theory

Implement a function that given a set of values of invariants of a binary quintic, finds a quintic that attains these values up to scaling. 

A general framework for reconstruction is implemented and the original invariant_theory module is moved to support this functionality.

This ticket requires binary quintics for computations and doctests, so depends on #25395.

I'm setting this to needs_work, since it depends on #25395, which currently needs work. When you set #25395 back to needs_review, if you think #25508 is ready for review, you can set it back to needs_review.

in python3:

```
AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'has_key'
```

You need to replace `d.has_key(y)` by `y in d`

Tickets still needing working or clarification should be moved to the next release milestone at the soonest (please feel free to revert if you think the ticket is close to being resolved).

I will implement a more general `binary_form_from_invariants` method, with an additional `binary_quintic_coefficients_from_invariants method`.

I intend to do a last check if there are sufficient doctests and references later this week; after that I will change to needs review again.

looks almost good.

Error messages should not end with a dot and should not start with a capital. They should look something like

```
IncredibleError: this banana is blue
```
