# Issue 20586: parse_label() in sage/modular/modform/constructor.py fails in GammaH case

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20823

Original creator: klui

Original creation time: 2016-06-14 03:57:47

Keywords: parse_label, modular_form

Currently, it does not return index in the GammaH case though the Gamma0 and Gamma1 case does.

In Newform(), both the group and the index is expected L485 in sage/modular/modform/constructor.py

You need to add a doctest illustrating the case that your change addresses.

Your docstring is not formatted properly and won't convert correctly to html/sphinx/etc.    Please see
http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#template
and especially the double colons.

still not correctly formatted. Lines ending with :: should be followed by an empty line

Please add you real name in the Authors box (here, top of this web page)

Hopefully this time! What's the name for this style of formatting?
