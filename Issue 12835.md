The new spkg builds successfully using gcc 4.6.3 and `SAGE_CHECK=yes` on x86_64 debian squeeze. I'll test some other archs / platforms tomorrow, but looks good so far!

The new spkg builds successfully using gcc 4.7.0 and `SAGE_CHECK=yes` on x86_64 Fedora 16 (skynet/eno). I'll test ubuntu and call it a wrap.

Building with `SAGE_CHECK=yes` on Ubunutu with gcc 4.4.3 (redhawk) works as well. I'm giving this a positive review.

I changed the milestones for #7436 and #8783 to duplicate since they are fixed by this ticket.

See also #8515 - Ben, do you have access to one of those Solaris machines?

I just had it pass with `SAGE_CHECK` on Mac OS.  However, the tests in sage/interfaces/frobby.py don't pass.

```

Otherwise we could really make it an optional package again after all this testing if it worked on Solaris.

I don't have access to drkirkby's machines. Maybe we can get him to test the package out. In any case I don't know anything about Solaris or SPARC platforms.
