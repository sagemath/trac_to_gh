As the commit message says, there were three identical doctests before, so I've removed one, changed one to something else, and changed one to something that passes with Python 3.

You're probably going to hate me, but can your force-push the commit again with a better formatted commit message? In particular the 1st line is treated special than the rest by git. So the 1-line short version should go there, then the longer description after that (I think usually people put a blankline between the two). This will make it easier when reading the history. Once done, you can set a positive review.

It was easy with `git commit --amend`.
