Keywords: sage -b rebuilds

Upon the upgrade of FLINT from 1.5.2 to 2.3 (#12173), its include directory in `$SAGE_LOCAL/include` was changed from all upper to all lower case (`FLINT/`-> `flint/`), and Sage library files including stuff from there were changed accordingly.

But, as originally reported on #14600, `$SAGE_SRC/module_list.py` still contained references to the old name, which led to continual unnecessary rebuilds of 23 extension modules having `depends = flint_depends`, because the latter was still `[SAGE_INC + '/FLINT/flint.h']`, a now non-existing file.

----

It seems the many `include_dirs = [SAGE_INC + '/FLINT']` in `module_list.py` were (and still are) superfluous anyway; i.e., apparently all files using FLINT already `#include "flint/foo.h"` rather than just `foo.h`, so we should remove those entries as well.

----

For backwards compatibility, it might be worth keeping a symbolic link `$SAGE_LOCAL/include/FLINT -> flint`, but that should be created in an updated FLINT spkg (more precisely, its `spkg-install`).

So is this patch still waiting for a review ? It does the job and it looks good to me, but if you think that it should be done in a different way...

Patch *"Looks good to me."*<sup>TM</sup>.

What I suggested is just one more step forward... (making it more modular and less error-prone by removing even more from `module_list.py`).

P.S.:  The code in `setup.py` I was referring to is

```python

# Do not put all, but only the most common libraries and their headers
# (that are likely to change on an upgrade) here:
# [At least at the moment. Make sure the headers aren't copied with "-p",
# or explicitly touch them in the respective spkg's spkg-install.]
lib_headers = { "gmp":     [ os.path.join(SAGE_INC,'gmp.h') ],   # cf. #8664, #9896
                "gmpxx":   [ os.path.join(SAGE_INC,'gmpxx.h') ]
              }

for m in ext_modules:

    for lib in lib_headers.keys():
        if lib in m.libraries:
            m.depends += lib_headers[lib]

    # FIMXE: Do NOT link the following libraries to each and
    #        every module (regardless of the language btw.):
    m.libraries = ['csage'] + m.libraries + ['stdc++', 'ntl']

    m.extra_compile_args += extra_compile_args
    m.extra_link_args += extra_link_args
    m.library_dirs += ['%s/lib' % SAGE_LOCAL]
```


We'd just have to add

```python
                "flint":   [ os.path.join(SAGE_INC,"flint","flint.h") ]
```

there.
