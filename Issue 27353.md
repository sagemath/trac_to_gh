Code changes all look good to me.  I learned a few things!  I did not know that you could do QQ.prod(), and also that 'x not in S' was valid instead of 'not x in S'.

The patchbot error is something completely irrelevant (building igraph).  So I will run tests myself.

LGTM seems very good.  I just completed the job of achieving 100% on eclib, but sage has 5.4k alerts to look into...

My bot is now green (python2). I had only checked with python3, not seeing an issue with old-style class.

I never got to manual testing for the usual reasons (it took an age to build and then dochtml failed for no good reason).  Since the bot is green anyway, I am happy.
