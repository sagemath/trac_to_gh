One can do:

```
sage= R.<x,y,z> = GF(2)[]
sage: I = ideal( [ x*y*z + x*z + y + 1, x+y+z+1] )
sage: sols = (I+sage.rings.ideal.FieldIdeal(R)).variety()
sage: sols
[{y: 1, z: 0, x: 0}, {y: 1, z: 1, x: 1}]

sage: sols[0][y]
1
```


Now the same thing fails in ``BooleanRing``'s:

```
sage: R.<x,y,z> = BooleanPolynomialRing()
sage: I = ideal( [ x*y*z + x*z + y + 1, x+y+z+1] )
sage: sols = I.variety()
sage: sols
[{y: 1, z: 0, x: 0}, {y: 1, z: 1, x: 1}]

sage: sols[0][y]
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
KeyError: y
```


This is caused by an ugly hack (I authored...) in #13103 to make the ``variety()`` function work on ``BooleanIdeal``'s.
