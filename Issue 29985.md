Fredrik Johansson mentions in his answer to

- [Ask Sage question 52653: Equality of algebraic numbers given as huge symbolic expressions](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/52653)

that one could write an interface to the `qqbar_t` module of Calcium.

There is now an interface to Calcium for Julia,
and an invitation to write one for SageMath, see
