For some reasons `m4rie` depends on `givaro` and `ntl`. Those dependency are bogus

```
readelf -d /usr/lib64/libm4rie-0.0.20150908.so

Dynamic section at offset 0x8fdd0 contains 27 entries:
  Tag        Type                         Name/Value
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libm4ri-0.0.20140914.so]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libpthread.so.0]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libc.so.6]
 0x000000000000000e (SONAME)             Library soname: [libm4rie-0.0.20150908.so]
```

and uses no headers from either `givaro` or `ntl`.
