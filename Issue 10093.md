I still can't build C++ cython modules, even though it should be possible with the cython-0.13. 

```
python `which cython` --embed-positions --directive cdivision=True,autotestdict=False -I/home/vbraun/opt/sage-4.5.3/devel/sage-main -o sage/geometry/ppl.cpp sage/geometry/ppl.pyx

/home/vbraun/opt/sage-4.5.3/devel/sage-main/sage/geometry/ppl.pyx:19:22: Operation only allowed in c++
```

The problem seems to be that cython expects `--cplus` to enable the new language features. Cython does not derive this from the output file name extension ('cpp').

I've written the obvious patch to `setup.py`, see attachment.

The problem is this snippet from `element_givaro.pyx`, where `PY_TYPE_CHECK` is declared a second time. It is then ambiguous with its first declaration.

```
cdef extern from "stdsage.h":
    [...]
    int PY_TYPE_CHECK(object o, object t)

Removing this one line works, patch attached. I did a `sage -ba` and had no more troubles.
