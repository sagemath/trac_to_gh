Maybe use `all` a little more in tests:

```diff
-            sage: [loads(dumps(b)).identical(b) for b in
-            ....:     [ComplexBallField(60)(1/3 + i*pi), CBF(NaN)]]
-            [True, True]
+            sage: balls = [ComplexBallField(60)(1/3 + i*pi), CBF(NaN)]
+            sage: all(loads(dumps(b)).identical(b) for b in balls)
+            True
```


```diff
-            sage: [loads(dumps(b)).identical(b) for b in
-            ....:     [RealBallField(60).pi(), RBF(infinity), RBF(NaN)]]
-            [True, True, True]
+            sage: balls = [RealBallField(60).pi(), RBF(infinity), RBF(NaN)]
+            sage: all(loads(dumps(b)).identical(b) for b in balls)
+            True
```

It makes it more difficult to see which test has failed.
