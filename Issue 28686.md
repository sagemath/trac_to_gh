# Issue 28686: Metaticket - Proposed changes to julia_plot

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28923

Original creator: @DaveWitteMorris

Keywords: Julia set

This metaticket lists proposed (or completed) changes to the `julia_plot` function.
	* #23740 generalizes `julia_plot` to all polynomials, instead of only the usual quadratic polynomial `z^2 + c`.
	* In order to make the generalization, #23740 changes the interface of `julia_plot` to be keyword based. Shouldn't this backwards-incompatible change have a deprecation notice? (If so, it would be good to get this deprecation into the 9.0 release.) I will create a ticket for this right away.
	* The new interface (created by gh-aodesky) in #23740 is generally an improvement, but I think we should retain a very simple interface for plotting the filled Julia set of `z^2 + c`, which is all that most users will want. I propose to replace the (deprecated) `julia_plot` with a function `julia_set_plot(c)` to plot the filled Julia set of `z^2 + c` (using an optimized algorithm), and a separate function `julia_set_of_polynomial_plot` for the general polynomials covered by #23740. The new functions will be experimental, in order to allow for continuing development in the next few weeks.
	* As explained in #28557, the algorithm in `julia_plot` uses a faulty calculation of the escape radius, so many plots do not show the entire Julia set. The patch in #28557 fixes this mistake for the special case of quadratic polynomials, but the correction needs to be extended to other polynomials.
	* The documentation says that `julia_plot` plots a Julia set, but it actually plots the _filled_ Julia set. The docstrings should be fixed.
	* The plot routines should be enhanced to utilize matplotlib colormaps, instead of only interpolating a color gradient between `base_color` and white. (In addition, the user should be able to choose the color of the filled Julia set, instead of being required to use black.) These options should also be provided for plots of the Mandelbrot set.
	* Instead of always plotting the entire Mandelbrot set, the user should be allowed to choose a plot window. (Close-up views of small parts of the Mandelbrot set are very interesting.)
	* In order to make axes and other options available to the user, perhaps the plot routines should be modified to use matplotlib (instead of directly creating a png file).
	* In a notebook interface, it would be great to be able to click on a point in the picture of the Mandelbrot set, to get a plot of the corresponding filled Julia set.

Batch modifying tickets that will likely not be ready for 9.1, based on a review of the ticket title, branch/review status, and last modification date.

Setting new milestone based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.

Let me add a comment here, since i am not sure if i should open a ticket. I see no difference between `julia_plot(interact=True)` and `julia_plot()`, i just get a static image with a Julia set on the left and a Mandelbrot set on the right. What interaction are we supposed to see ? Sliders ? Input boxes ? Clicking on the image ?

Thanks for the bug report.  We're supposed to get some sliders (and also two color-choosers), but it doesn't work for me either.  Please try:

```
R.<z> = CC[]
f = z^2 + 1/2
julia_plot(f,interact=True)
```

This works for me (in a jupyter notebook or on `CoCalc`).

I take it back: `julia_plot(interact=True)` is working for me now, both in a jupyter notebook on Mac OS 11.5.2 and in `CoCalc`.

This is pretty weird, on my side also, sometimes it works, sometimes no, but i could not guess what triggers the issue.
