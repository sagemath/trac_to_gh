Since sage-4.3.rc0 should build on Solaris, I think we need a README file. But I agree with William's suggestion some time ago, that this is a link to a Wiki. So the attached README.Solaris basically tells people where to get information on building Sage on Solaris. 

I'll update the Wili regularly.

One of the links is dead, and the wiki hasn't been updated since 2011. I think if we're going to support one of the Solaris descendants in the future, we'll be starting from scratch anyway (ideally with far fewer special instructions). OpenIndiana, for example, now uses GCC.
