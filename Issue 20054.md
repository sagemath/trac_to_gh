We don't attach tarball to tickets anymore.

Well, I need to put the tarball somewhere (upstream doesn't publish tarballs right now)

If upstream doesn't provide any tarball, this is a snapshot you made yourself from the git repo. Could you make a `spkg-src` so making the tarball is somewhat reproducible?

Makes sense, I've added it.

In `spkg-src`, why not use

```
FPLLL_SAGE_VERSION=`cat package-version.txt |sed 's/[.]p.*//'`
```

(after the `cd $SPKG_ROOT` obviously)

Changing status from needs_review to needs_work.

More importantly: checkout a specific commit instead of using whatever `git clone` gives by default. Otherwise it's not reproducible at all.

And write your name as author on this ticket.

Hi there, can I tempt anyone to review this?

Patchbot never tests package related stuff. How could it ever found the tarball?
