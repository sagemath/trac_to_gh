Keywords: SI2019

The function is_conjugate failed for degree 1 maps. Implemented a fix that reduced the problem to testing conjugacy via similar matrices (over PGL2).

Adjusted the documentation to make it clear over which ring conjugacy is being tested. 

Added a parameter to enable choice of ring over which conjugacy is being tested. 

Added early exit based on sigma invariants for dimension 1 if testing conjugacy over a number field or a finite field. 

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28070

``R'' needs to be added to the INPUT section of the docs

Also you should use the keyword as a keyword, i.e. 

```
f.is_conjugate(g, R=QQbar)
```

Finally, the new TEST seems like a good one as an EXAMPLE and it helps the user see the difference. It also needs to be marked

```
# long time
```
as it takes more than 1s.

Two small typos in conjugating_set documentation:
"Determine to see if" (remove "to see")
"by by" (second "by" hard to spot as it's on a new line)

Bigger issue, the following fails:

```python
P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(GF(5), 1)
f = DynamicalSystem_projective([7*x + 12*y, 8*x])
g = DynamicalSystem_projective([5*x - 8*y, 3*x - 8*y])
m = f.conjugating_set(g)[0]
f.conjugate(m) == g
```

returns false but

```python
f.conjugate(matrix(GF(5),2,2,[1,0,1,1]).inverse())==g
```

returns true. 

The problem seems to be in the field of definition of m is the algebraic closure of GF(5) which then changes the of f.conjugate(m) to also be the algebraic closure.

Since the conjugating set is nonempty, it should return true. 
It works properly when K is replaced by an infinite field.
