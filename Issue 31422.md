This new method will return the affine hull of the polyhedron as an embedded submanifold of the ambient space, with a default chart defining coordinates that are the same as those that `affine_hull_projection` gives.


Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31659

Here's a beginning.

Unfortunately `affine_hull_projection(as_affine_map=True)` is a bit strange - it does not return everything what we need: The inverse affine map, from the projection back to the polyhedron. Maybe we should add more output options to this function (see also #27366)
