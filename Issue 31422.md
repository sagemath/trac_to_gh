This new method will return the affine hull of the polyhedron as an embedded submanifold of the ambient space, with a default chart defining coordinates that are the same as those that `affine_hull_projection` gives.

Here's a beginning.

Unfortunately `affine_hull_projection(as_affine_map=True)` is a bit strange - it does not return everything what we need: The inverse affine map, from the projection back to the polyhedron. Maybe we should add more output options to this function (see also #27366)

The plotting is best tested with #31600

It seems I need to make this a foliation so that I get access to a volume form

Ready for review; the failure on one of the patchbots is unrelated (#28559)
