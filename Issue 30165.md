Hello,
I am currently trying to convert my Boolean-Cayley-graphs project from Python 2 to Python 3 Sage. https://github.com/penguian/Boolean-Cayley-graphs/tree/23-port-to-python-3

I have succeeded in converting the code, but cannot load objects that were saved by my previous Python 2-based code. These objects contain matrices as members. 

As far as I can tell, load(...,encoding='latin-1') fails to load a dict containing a matrix but load(...,encoding='bytes') loads but does not restore the original object. See the attachments, showing a script run on Cocalc, and its results.
