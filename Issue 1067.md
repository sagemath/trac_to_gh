1. It should say "Moin Moin wiki with math typesetting" (this will be trivial to fix).

| Type notebook() for the GUI, and license() for information.        |
Please wait while the SAGE Notebook server starts...

```


2. Spam filtering should be on by default and anon access off.
I.e., the wikiconfig file *should* look like the attached one.
This should be easy to fix, once somebody remembers where the
default wikiconfig.py file is in the sage install.
