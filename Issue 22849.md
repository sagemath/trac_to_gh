The cyclegraph() function for Projective Morphisms raises a value error whenever a function has indeterminacy points. I will fix this by adding an exception for value errors.

A couple procedural things:

- the red branch names means there is a merge conflict. It is best to work based off of more recent beta.

- you should start the merge commit with the ticket number

- you should change it to needs-review when you're ready.

- tests should be as fast as possible unless there is a good reason for a longer test. So I changed the base field for one of your tests

I also made a couple changes

- I fixed the merge conflict

- I fixed the spacing (you had an extra tab everywhere)

- the subscheme case didn't work.

I'll change it to needs-review, but after you pull, test, and approve my changes, you can switch it to positive.
