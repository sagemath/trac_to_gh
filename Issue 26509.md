Original creator: mantepse

Original creation time: 2018-11-22 19:49:43

Keywords: FriCAS

In particular, this is good for integration:

```
sage: _ = var('x, y, z')
sage: f = sin(x^2) + y^z
sage: f.integrate(x, algorithm='fricas').simplify()
1/2*sqrt(2)*sqrt(pi)*(sqrt(2)*x*y^z/sqrt(pi) + fresnel_sin(sqrt(2)*x/sqrt(pi)))
```
