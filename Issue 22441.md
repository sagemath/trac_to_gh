This issue is not Sage-specific at all, it is a general distutils thing.

One could even argue that this isn't a bug: if you set certain environment variables (like `CC`) during the *build*, maybe you should set those same variables anytime you compile extension modules? (I'm not saying that I agree with this, just that the distutils behaviour is not obviously wrong).

Right. We could certainly use ideas from #21479 to implement that (ideally using `./configure` logic). But that's a different ticket...

There's your problem...

If you mess with `sage-env` and it breaks stuff, don't complain.

I guess there is an issue to be fixed, but it's not in compiling Cython code, it's in setting the right environment variables (i.e. what I mentioned in [comment:5])

Yes, thinking about it `distutils` gets it default from the configuration of python - all stored in `sysconfig.py`. So `LDSHARED` used for linking is set at configuration time to clang but `CC` is overridden at runtime by something setup in `sage-env`.

I made my `sage-env` hack more sophisticated and now it works out of the box

Still doing something in `configure` is more appealing.

So your toolchain is `clang` + `clang++` + `gfortran`? Does that actually work to compile all of Sage? I seem to remember issues with packages mixing Fortran and C code (R in particular).

Yes and yes again.

> I seem to remember issues with packages mixing Fortran and C code (R in particular).

You can get into trouble because historically there is no standard for the mangling of fortran functions names - although it is technically resolved in f95+ by providing c-binding, it is not as widely used as it should. A lot of C code in R that calls to fortran library assume "gnu" style mangling where a function "foo" should be called as `foo_` from C. 

Now suppose that you build R and you don't a BLAS/LAPACK handy. R provides a minimal subset of netlib lapack for its internal use in this case (at least it did), for which you need a fortran compiler. If the fortran compiler is, say, xlf (IBM fortran compiler) were the name mangling by default is plain `foo`, your build of R will break down while building the standard packages [I talk from experience]. Most fortran compiler have some options to change the mangling of objects so it is solvable by knowing the right incantation.

Now, well written packages using autotools can detect the mangling of your fortran compiler and adjust the name of functions accordingly. The right fortran compiler has to be provided at configure time for this to work. Oh and the detection can break if the optimisation is too aggressive [first hand experience again].
