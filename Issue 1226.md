```
[01:01] <mabshoff> I just fixed the annoying "transposing..." print out in cremona.spkg
[01:03] <was__> cremona sent me a bundle or something that has a fix for that and more.
```

So, I will wait for the update from John.

Cheers,

Michael

Well, William was wrong, there isn't any update bundle. But the spkg at 

http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/mabshoff/cremona-20071116.p0.spkg

contains at least a temporary fix.

Cheers,

Michael
