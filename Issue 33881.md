I don't see any problems with the upgrade, but I am concerned that sympy is core functionality in symbolics so I wonder if this is too late in the release cycle for adequate testing?

The automated systems do not seem to have successfully tested the ticket.  (Do they not have `--enable-download-from-upstream-url`?)  So I ran `make testlong` on CoCalc (Ubuntu 20.04) and got only two errors, which I think are known, and have nothing to do with this ticket:
