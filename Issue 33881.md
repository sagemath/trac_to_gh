I don't see any problems with the upgrade, but I am concerned that sympy is core functionality in symbolics so I wonder if this is too late in the release cycle for adequate testing?

The automated systems do not seem to have successfully tested the ticket.  (Do they not have `--enable-download-from-upstream-url`?)  So I ran `make testlong` on CoCalc (Ubuntu 20.04) and got only two errors, which I think are known, and have nothing to do with this ticket:

```
sage -t --long --warn-long 81.9 --random-seed=241846751556032050884921104136244529069 src/sage/interfaces/expect.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/interfaces/expect.py", line 937, in sage.interfaces.expect.Expect._eval_line
Failed example:
    singular.interrupt()
Expected:
    True
Got:
    False
**********************************************************************

    singular('2+3')

I'm planning a SymPy 1.11.1 release imminently after this:
https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/23976

I don't know if that affects SAGE but you might want to hold off until that gets released.
