This module computes the map from a elliptic curve in a toric surface to its Weierstrass form.

```
    sage: R.<x,y> = QQ[]
    sage: cubic = x^3 + y^3 + 1
    sage: WeierstrassMap(cubic)
    (-x^3*y^3 - x^3 - y^3, 
     1/2*x^6*y^3 - 1/2*x^3*y^6 - 1/2*x^6 + 1/2*y^6 + 1/2*x^3 - 1/2*y^3, 
     x*y)
```

Running it just for the 10th is OK, so looks more like a singular interface issue, but may be worth investigation...

Replying to [comment:12 novoselt]:
> Wouldn't it be more natural if `transformation=True` returned it *in addition* to the normal form rather than instead of?

This is still applicable, but otherwise the patch looks good to me modulo some typos fixed in reviewer patch and apparently is works for #3416 ;-)

I thought about whether to return both when `transformation=True` when I wrote the code originally, but then decided against it. Its not particularly natural the way the computation goes. If speed is an issue (and its at worst a factor 2x for calling `WeierstrassForm` twice, and in reality its much faster to compute the Weierstrass form without transformation) then you should parametrize the coefficients and derive the formula in one step. So there isn't really any justification.

Reviewer patch looks good to me.
