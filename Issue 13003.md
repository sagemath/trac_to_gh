And it's notably faster than the old Mercurial.

Applying _all_ patches in the merger script, using sage-5.0.1 as a base (user CPU time):

```
sage-5.1.beta5:               2m4.510s
sage-5.1.beta6:               2m9.640s
sage-5.1.rc0:                2m21.850s
sage-5.1 + mercurial-2.2.2:  1m36.400s
```
