Maybe all calls to `field_to_int` are done safely such that doesn't occur in practice. But still, it seems safer to have proper exception handling here.

The easiest solution seems to be to return a Python object from `field_to_int` and do the conversion to `int` later.

Simon, what you do think about this:

That seems to make sense.

If I see that correctly, `field_to_int` actually returns non-negative integers. Therefore, it would be easiest to impose `except -1` in the function declaration.

Are you sure that's how the function is used? It is supposed to be a conversion between good old Sage field elements (python objects!) and FEL.

In any case, if you have a function returning FEL, you can do `except 255` without `?`, as the size of a field is at most 251.

OK, as long as you do not want to change the input of `field_to_int` or the output of `int_to_field`, because that would clearly be a Sage object (element of `GF(25,'x')`, for example).

Then, it should probably be called `field_to_fel` and `fel_to_field`. How could these be doc tested, as FEL is a C type?
