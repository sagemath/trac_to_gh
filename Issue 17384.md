This branch exposes GAP's feature of computing the stabilizer of a set of points. Right now, Sage only know how to compute the stabilizer of a point.

```
sage: G.stabilizer(['a'],"OnMonkeys")
```

Note that there are other interesting actions available from GAP
- `OnTuples` (for stabilizers, these are simply intersection of action on points)
- `OnSetsSets`
- `OnSetsDisjointSets`

There are no rules (yet) about this kind of things `:-P`

True. To be honest, I did not want to generalize the code from `.orbits` (which handles all cases) for only two functions. But then, if a third one needs that, you know... `:-P`
