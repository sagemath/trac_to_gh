This works:


```
sage: sr = mq.SR(1,2,2,4,gf2=True, polybori=True, order='deglex')
sage: F,s = sr.polynomial_system()
sage: F.eliminate_linear_variables()
Polynomial Sequence with 103 Polynomials in 55 Variables
```


This doesn't:


```
sage: sr = mq.SR(1,2,2,4,gf2=True, polybori=True, order='degrevlex')
sage: F,s = sr.polynomial_system()                                  
sage: F.eliminate_linear_variables()                                
...
IndexError: index of root must be less than the values of roots of the branches.
```

Thanks, the code indeed assumes that the indices really
coincide with the diag. structure, i.e. are consistent (all index accessing functions
give really the same result).
`top_index  <-> .navigation().value()`, 
or `v.index()`
which are really the same, if you don't do anything,
more problematics looks `iter(Monomial(v).variables()).next().index()` to be the same (but does not seem to be the problem).
Moreover, we assume here that indices coincide with diag structure (i.e. < relation on indices has a meaning).

Be aware that in this case code is broken while in other cases it might be just extremely slow when using wrong indices.
I must say that I have extreme 	 bellyache for this index game. I appreciate all efforts on the topic.

Maybe we should just deprecate this degrevlex business?

I was afraid of asking it. We would really prefer doing so.
I understand that it's a lack of convenience, but still nothing is worth the trouble.
