Instead of calling `setup_sage_signal_handler()` from `stdsage.c`, call it instead from Cython when importing `sage.ext.interrupt` (renamed from `sage.ext.c_lib`).

This also bypasses the initialization of the `global_empty_tuple` from `stdsage.c`, but that is no longer used since #17668.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17900
