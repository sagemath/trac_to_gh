# Issue 17663: Setup interrupts in Cython

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2015-03-05 12:23:26

Instead of calling `setup_sage_signal_handler()` from `stdsage.c`, call it instead from Cython when importing `sage.ext.interrupt` (renamed from `sage.ext.c_lib`).

This also bypasses the initialization of the `global_empty_tuple` from `stdsage.c`, but that is no longer used since #17668.

`interrupt.pyx` should probably be linked somewhere in the reference manual. Otherwise LGTM.

Oh, and there is a comment still referring to `c_lib.pyx` in `interrupt.c`.

Rebased on top of the current beta and fixed the mess with `reference/libs/index.rst` in `public/17900-interrupt`. Please change the branch on this ticket and set to positive review if this solution is okay with you.
