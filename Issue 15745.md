# Issue 15745: Python 3 preparation: Change the syntax of the except clause

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15982

Original creator: wluebbe

Original creation time: 2014-03-20 15:13:10

Keywords: python3

Only the modern syntax of the except clause (in the try-except statement) is accepted by Python 3.  


Changes according to `lib2to3/fixes/fix_except.py`:

```
- "except E, T:" where T is a name:

    except E as T:

- "except E, T:" where T is not a name, tuple or list:

        except E as t:
            T = t

    This is done because the target of an "except" clause must be a
    name.

- "except E, T:" where T is a tuple or list literal:

        except E as t:
            T = t.args
```


This ticket is tracked as a dependency of meta-ticket ticket:15980.
