works with gap

```
sage: SymmetricGroup(3)(gap("(1,3)"))
(1,3)
```
fails with libgap

```
sage: SymmetricGroup(3)(libgap.eval("(1,3)"))
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: 'sage.libs.gap.element.GapElement_Permutation' object is not iterable
```
Though we have

```
sage: libgap.eval("(1,3)").sage()
(1,3)
sage: parent(_)
Symmetric group of order 3! as a permutation group
```

This is fixed by #31404, though this ticket should remain open until/unless that one is merged:

```
sage: SymmetricGroup(3)(libgap.eval("(1,3)"))                                                                                                                                                    
(1,3)
sage: parent(_)
