This lets scipy build on macOS 12.3, thanks.
Should this be tested on GH Actions?

It's likely unproblematic, but yes, let's test it. Maybe together with another update ticket such as #33512?

This is on an Apple Silicon M1 Mac with macOS 11.6.5 (Big Sur), with Homebrew up to date.
After merging #33512 #32207 #33492 #33522, `make` gives

`[pythran-0.11.0]   Error downloading pythran-0.11.0.tar.gz`

And indeed it seems that only `pythran-0.10.0.tar.gz` is available.

Logs attached.

You need `./configure --enable-download-from-upstream-url` on upgrade tickets like this one

It works.

Sorry for the noise and my ignorance.

FWIW, Positive review on Apple Silicon M1 Macs with Homebrew up to date, both macOS 11.6.5 (Big Sur) with Xcode 13.2.1 and macOS 12.3 (Monterey) with Xcode 13.3.
