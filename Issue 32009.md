In this change to `vertex_cut` (and possibly in other places in the file)

```
                     # if the vertex is not in the cut
-                    if not (x in b and b[x] == 1):
-                        if (x in v and v[x] == 1):
+                    if not (x in b and b[x]):
+                        if (x in v and v[x]):
                             l1.append(x)
```

how about changing `x in b and b[x]` to `b.get(x, False)`
