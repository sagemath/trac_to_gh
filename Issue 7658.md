We've switched to VirtualBox for using Sage on Windows, but the installation guide still refers to VMWare: http://www.sagemath.org/doc/installation/binary.html#microsoft-windows

We should update this to reflect our current setup.

I didn't actually try to apply the patch, but how could it fail? It's now correct, so positive review here.
