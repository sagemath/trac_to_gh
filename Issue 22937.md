I did not run full doctests. Let's see what the patchbot thinks about this one.

When I build the documentation there is an error complaining that the reference [GiTr1996] is introduced twice. 

The code itself is fine. Thanks!

I also made some reviewer changes. Basically they are all done to improve the C code generated by Cython. One thing that might be more controversial is my unrolling of

```python
        for i in range(deg):
            v += x.list()
            x *= yp
```

I did this so you don't create as many temporary objects and to avoid the repeated calls to `self._parent.degree()` and `self._parent.polynomial()`. If you don't want the more complicated code, feel free to revert the last commit.

I don't mind these changes though I doubt that they make a difference.

Feel free to set this to positive review.
