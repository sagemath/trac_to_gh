Somebody asked on AskSage how to compute the faces of a graph. And well, one wouldn't think of looking for `trace_faces`, to let's rename it `:-P`

A few minor things:

- The alignment of the ```embedding``` input bullet-point is off by a space (lines 3729-3734).
- Instead of `doctest:1: message` could you change it to the more robust `doctest:...: message`?
- Could you use `Return` instead of `Returns` on line 3721?
- I believe the error messages should be formatted as `ValueError("lower case with no period")`.

Otherwise looks good. Thanks.

Helloooooooooooo ! I fixed all of those except the last one. I don't think that it is soooo dangerous, plus I often write (informative) exceptions messages with several sentences (in which case upper case and periods are needed), and I think it helps `^^;`

I thought that there was some PEP on this...but I can't find it, so it's a consistency with python/personal preference. *shrugs*

Positive review. Thanks Nathann.

There should be a PEP against PEP. Thaaaaanks for the review `:-)`

Gosh, these days Sage is the only place where stuff is actually happening, and where people actually work toward something `O_o`
