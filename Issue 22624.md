# Issue 22624: Implement Adams operators on group characters

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22861

Original creator: tscrim

Original creation time: 2017-04-24 06:29:31

Keywords: adams operators

The k-th Adams operator A<sup>k</sup> on a character X is given by

A<sup>k</sup>(X)(g) = X(g<sup>k</sup>).

We implement this on characters and fix a small bug with libgap class functions not having a `_libgap_` method.
