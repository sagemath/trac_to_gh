This is one of those (annoying) long error messages with multiple sentences that needs leading capitalization and period:

```diff
-            raise ValueError("The given class id does not exist in the ISGCI database. Is the db too old ? You can update it with graph_classes.update_db().")
+            raise ValueError("the given class id does not exist in the ISGCI database. Is the db too old ? You can update it with graph_classes.update_db()")
```

However, this one should not have a period:

```
raise ValueError(str(I) + " is not a vertex of the graph.")
```
