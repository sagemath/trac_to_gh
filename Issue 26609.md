Unfortunately, the fixed doctests are not the same with python3. The certificate of isomorphism is different. Maybe we should make these doctests more robust and more conceptual.

Right, we could have some robust doctests to ensure that the result is correct and some `# not tested` doctests to illustrate the expected output. There are several places where the output ordering is different in py2 and py3.

I have removed the dict from some doctests. These doctests are not here to doctest the `is_isomorphic` method itself, so I think there is not need to use the certificate. We can either forget it, or just not ask for it..

This does not fix completely the homology folder for python3, but this is still some progress on the way.

patchbot is green. This seems to be ready for review now.

apart from the possibly missing empty line between bullets, this patch looks good to me.

```diff
+        - ``vertices`` - a list of vertex labels
+        - ``labels`` - boolean, whether to return labels as well
```
