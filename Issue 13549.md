Assignee: jason, mpatel, was

CC:  @jasongrout @kcrisman

Keywords: notebook logged out

When I run two notebooks (different directories) at the same time, then I am logged out of one, when doing something in the other. More precisely:

- run notebook 1, open worksheet A
- run notebook 2, open worksheet B
- now click 'Home' in worksheet A, and you will be asked to log in again

This happens since 5.2. 

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13753

My guess is that this is an issue with the cookies for the servers being confused somehow.

I think the problem is that the port number is not taking into account: I am running several servers for different purposes on the same machine and so they have the same domain name - the difference is only in the port.

A long time ago we also had problems with the cookie and I thought Tim Dumol added the port number to the cookie.  But you're right that it should be checked.

I can see `nb_session_<port_numer>` cookie mentioned in the code above, but there is also a cookie named just `session` and once I deleted it, I got logged out. I suppose it is created/overwritten by each notebook server and then it works only for the one that was singed into last.
