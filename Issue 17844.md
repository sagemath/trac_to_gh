# Issue 17844: Expression.factor_list() result inconsistent

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18081

```
sage: (1-2^(-s)).factor_list()
[(2^s - 1, 1), (2^s, -1)]
sage: (1/(1-2^(-s))).factor_list()
[(2^s - 1, -1), (2, s)]
```

I would have expected the first expression to have `(2, -s)` or the second to have `(2^s, 1)`.
