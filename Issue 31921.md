Keywords: ppl, lazy double description

We make the ppl backend somewhat lazy.

This is a preparation for allowing interactive modification.

The goal is that `normaliz` and `polymake` use `Polyhedron_interactive` as well and allow adding generators/inequalities.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32158

IMO, the constructor `Polyhedron` should get an additional keyword argument `immutable=True` (unfortunately there's a bit of inconsistency - in the Sage library one finds all three of `immutable=`, `is_mutable=`, `is_immutable=`).
When `False`, it should select a suitable backend

Thanks for the comments. Yes, using `immutable` is much better. I would prefer to not have another backend though. It's the same with vectors and matrices. One can just make them immutable, if one likes to, but not the other way around.

I'm just saying that `Polyhedron`, if no backend is given and `is_mutable=True` is passed, should select one of the backends that support mutation. As of this or a follow-up ticket, I guess that's only ppl.

I fixed faces to be unhashable when taken from a mutable polyhedron (or that actually happens automatically). This means that in particular we cannot create graphs or hasse diagrams for faces.

I also invalidate all objects that point towards the polyhedron, when the polyhedron is changed. I don't know if this is good or if a user is responsible for not keeping objects pointing on polyhedra that might change.

I also changed the behavior to not recycle Vrepresentation and Hrepresentation objects when clearing the cache. This why I at least prevent that an representation object that a user keeps changes at some point.
