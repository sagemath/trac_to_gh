This is metaticket to be a place for random things to add for finite posets and lattices.

- From #18941: Add possibility to check if a list is a *saturated* chain of a poset.
- Add `is_eulerian()`.
- Add a function to generate random lattice.
- Add "standar example" (poset of `2n` elements with dimension `n` to poset catalog.
- Add divisor lattice to poset catalog.
