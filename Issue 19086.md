This is metaticket to be a place for random things to add for finite posets and lattices.

**New functions**

- From #18941: Add possibility to check if a list is a *saturated* chain of a poset. (Done: #20494)
- Add `is_eulerian()`. (Done: #19697)
- Add a function to generate random lattice.

**Poset catalog**

- Add "standar example" (poset of `2n` elements with dimension `n`). (Done: #19690)
- Add divisor lattice. (#20272)

**Other**

- Think about `ceritificate`-options. Should for example `is_meet_semilattice()` return a pair of elements without a meet?

**Minor bugs**

- `is_supersolvable` gives error on empty lattice. (#20274)
