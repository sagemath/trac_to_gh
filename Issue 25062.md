Here are two ways to perform the same computation

```
sage: QQT = QQ['T']
sage: QQXT.<X,T> = QQ['X,T']
sage: p = QQT(8 * T^9 + 4*T^6 - 4*T^3 - 1)
sage: pp = QQXT(p)
sage: q1 = p.composed_op(p, operator.add, algorithm='resultant')
sage: q2 = pp.subs(T=X).resultant(pp(T = T - X))
sage: print(q1 == q2)
True
```

Though direct call to resultant is 1000 times faster

```
sage: %timeit p.composed_op(p, operator.add, algorithm='resultant')
1 loop, best of 3: 1.68 s per loop
sage: %timeit pp(T=X).resultant(pp(T=T-X))
100 loops, best of 3: 2.38 ms per loop
```


This was found while checking Ramanujan inequality

```
sage: left = cos(2*pi/7)^(1/3) - (-cos(4*pi/7))^(1/3) - (-cos(8*pi/7))^(1/3)
sage: right = -(-(5 - 3*7^(1/3))/2)^(1/3)
sage: left.n()
-0.717515079649940
sage: right.n()
-0.717515079649940
```

And in this example, BFSS is actually faster

```
sage: %timeit q1 = p.composed_op(p, operator.add, algorithm='BFSS')
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.17 ms per loop
```

(... for another round)
