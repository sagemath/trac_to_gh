See #23812

I do not agree with the "needs work" status, unless you explain precisely what "work" is required on the specific changes made here.

My point is that #23812 and #23848 and #23648 solve essentially the same problem. So there should clearly be a uniform solution. Once we decided on a uniform solution (probably in #23648), we can use it in all related tickets.

Also in that list of tickets is #23857 which deals specifically with C++.

I have created a new ticket that just wants to introduce the conversion tools: #24186.

Erik, is this ticket made obsolete by one of your tickets ?

Not, specifically, but I have fixed most of these issues in my branch, except for the one in the homfly module since I didn't have libhomfly installed.  I'll add a replacement.

Attached branch fixes str/bytes issues in the same modules as your original branch, and no more, no less :)
