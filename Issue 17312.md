So does it work with complex number in general, or not ? Could you tell me how you would like me to rephrase that ? Or could you add a commit ? I do not see exactly how I should say it.

Perhaps add something along the lines of

```
If a doctest with tolerance contains several numbers, each of them is checked individually::

    sage: print "The sum of 1 and 1 equals 5"  # abs tol 1
    The sum of 2 and 2 equals 4

As a consequence of this, tests involving complex numbers, matrices or polynomials usually work as expected::

    sage: <complex number example here>
    sage: M = Matrix(RR, 3, 3, [-13, 1, 1, -3, 0, -2, -4, -2, 0])
    sage: M^-1 * M   # actual result
    [     1.00000000000000  6.93889390390723e-18 -6.24500451351651e-17]

    sage: M^-1 * M   # tol 2e-16
    [ 1.00000000000000 0.000000000000000 0.000000000000000]

    [0.000000000000000 0.000000000000000  1.00000000000000]

Note that, in the last example, the zeros are checked with **absolute** tolerance, while the non-zero entries are checked with **relative** tolerance.

No!

The rule is:

- zero values: tested with absolute tolerance by default

- non-zero values: tested with relative tolerance by default

But `abs` or `rel` can override the default for both cases.

> `sage -t --optional=internet` only runs the internet tests, and not any of the tests that are run by default. You almost always want `sage -t --optional=sage,internet`, and similar for other optional packages.

True. Actually, I never ran --optional without having 'sage' inside. Should we change that instead ? I can't think of any good reason for this kind of behaviour, as it does create confusion.

Hello guys !

> What about the --optional=sage,keyword?

It is already documented in the chapter (that this patch renames to) "Running the doctests". The section about the 'optional' flag begins with a link toward that page

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/doctesting.html#run-optional-tests

I think that it is sufficient for the moment, especially since we all seem to agree that this behaviour should be changed so that 'sage' is always included in `--optional=<a list>`.

> `A line flagged with ``optional - keyword```, it is not tested: remove `", it"`
Done.

> I really think that it should be involves since "representation" is singular.
Done.

> Also, maybe we should emphasize that the "32-bit" and "64-bit" flags go on the output lines.
Done

From the look of your comments I have no idea if you consider that this ticket can be switched to `positive_review` yet, but I would really appreciate it if you could make all your comments at once, next time. I have already pushed 6 different review commits here, and that is much more work than implementing at once all of the reviewer's comments.
