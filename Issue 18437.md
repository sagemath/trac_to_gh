Question: Should I leave the line

```
    sage/combinat/choose_nk
```

in `/src/doc/en/reference/combinat/module_list.rst`?  There are two functions `rank` and `from_rank` that are still in that file.

Sage 6.3 was released on 10 August 2014, so this cannot be merged before 10 August 2015.

If you want a review, you should switch the status to needs review...

Changing status from new to needs_review.

I felt it necessary to handle a TODO in `choose_nk.py` before switching the status which suggested that the `choose_nk.rank` and `choose_nk.from_rank` functions should be moved.  I put them in `combination.py` since they were being used there (they are also used in `subsets.py`).  I would not expect that they are being used elsewhere, but I thought it was a good idea to deprecate them as functions in `choose_nk.py`.

You should also change `doctest:1:` to `doctest:...:`.
