Implement functionality to generate Chebyshev polynomials of a given kind and degree as: proper polynomials, as polynomials in affine space, and as projective morphisms.

Changing priority from major to minor.

Do you mean something other than the usual Chebyshev polynomials of the first/second kind? Those are generated by `chebyshev_T` and `chebyshev_U`.

Typos in the docstrings: for `chebyshev_polynomial` (both occurrences), "ofrecursively" and "Chebyhshev". More significantly, could you add doctests (in both functions) for the `TypeError` when the projective space is of the wrong dimension?

Thanks for catching those typos. Doc test added.

Looks fine to me, and passes `make ptestlong` for me. Positive review.
