Keywords: sd86.5

This should return ``True``

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: S.<x> = QQ[]
sage: S.quo(x^2 + 1).coerce_map_from(R.quo(x^2 + 1)).is_injective()
```


Generally, if `Râ†’S` is injective/surjective then the quotient is.

I think the mathematical content of the statement if R -> S is injective then the quotient is, is no true. A counter example is for example 
`ZZ['x'].quo(2) == GF(2)['x']` which does not inject into `QQ['x'].quo(2) == 0`. This example is not a pathology of 2 being in the constant field, it fails for any polynomial whose content is not a unit.

A nice sufficient condition for injectivity is that the polynomial be monic (or more generally if its leading coefficient is a unit).

There are no problems with surjectivity.
