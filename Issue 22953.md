```
Keywords: sd86.5

This should return ``True``

```
sage: R.<x> = ZZ[]
sage: S.<x> = QQ[]
sage: S.quo(x^2 + 1).coerce_map_from(R.quo(x^2 + 1)).is_injective()
```


Generally, if `Râ†’S` is injective/surjective then the quotient is.

I think the mathematical content of the statement if R -> S is injective then the quotient is, is no true. A counter example is for example 
`ZZ['x'].quo(2) == GF(2)['x']` which does not inject into `QQ['x'].quo(2) == 0`. This example is not a pathology of 2 being in the constant field, it fails for any polynomial whose content is not a unit.

A nice sufficient condition for injectivity is that the polynomial be monic (or more generally if its leading coefficient is a unit).

There are no problems with surjectivity.

```
if self.domain().modulus().change_ring(self.codomain().base_ring()) == self.codomain().modulus() and self.domain().modulus().leading_coefficient().is_unit():

in such a way that they comfortably fit on a reasonable screen and all the doctests pass. Then this ticket gets a positive review from me.


P.s. In reviewing this ticket I also found some mathematically incorrect behaviour of quotients of univariate polynomials rings. I created a separate ticket for this: #23621
