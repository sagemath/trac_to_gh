Long story : see [sage-support](https://groups.google.com/g/sage-support/c/5-jWlDsITH4).

TL;DR : On Debian testing, upgrading system Python (to 3.9.8) makes command-line `sage` crash at startup :

```


Neither recompiling IPython nor the whole thing is effective.

Obvious (but painful) workaround :


```
./configure --with-system-python3=no && make
```

Please try if this update helps; it is advertised to have fixes for python 3.10, but maybe it helps for 3.9.8 too

`SageMath version 9.5.beta2` is old. Can you test with the current `beta5` instead?

This patch allows Sage 9.5.beta5 to be configured wit system Python at 3.9.8 and run successfully from the command line.

Running `ptestlong`...

Passes `ptestlong` with no novel problem. ==> `positive_review`.

A crosscheck on other systems may be useful...

Thanks for testing!

Seems necessary on various systems, so it should be a blocker.
