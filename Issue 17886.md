IMHO `.iter_process` should return an iterator in every case. Wouldn't it be cleaner to remove automatic_output from `.iter_process` alltogether and move this convenience option to `.process` or even only to the convenience method `__call__`?

Further comments:
* Introductory example: The sentence "Here processing works with iterators in background." is unclear to me.
* code of `__call__`: in the branch `if ... input_tape.is_finite() == False`:, the check `if not 'automatic_output_type' in kwargs` seems to be superfluous because it is set before.
* `__call__`: Claims that automatic_output_type is set, but it is not.
* documentation of `.process`: What is the difference in the results of `automatic_output_type=False` and `automatic_output_type=None`?
* Please include doctests for `automatic_output_type`.
* Code of `iter_process`: IMHO setting `kwargs['format_output']` once and using it once, but then again guarded by `if_automatic_output_type` is some kind of overkill and also some kind of abuse of that parameter.
* For simplicity, I'd prefer to eliminate the possibility `automatic_output=None`: The magic that `format_output` is investigated in order to determine `automatic_output` could as well be moved to `__call__`. I can hardly imagine a use case of calling `.process` directly with `automatic_output=None`.

`.iter_process` returns an iterator, but it can be of any type (depending on input type/class) which supports iterating. Thus did not change it.

> Further comments: [...]
