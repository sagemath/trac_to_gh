It's building now so I can run some tests. But one question from looking through the code.

In a couple places you've changed


```
copy(Q)
```

to

```
self(copy(Q))
```

When copying a subscheme point it preserves the codomain, so is there a particular reason you're adding that extra coercion to the subscheme?

Everything else seems like standard clean-up.

yes, this is the main reason for this ticket.

I want all members of an orbit to belong to the same parent. If the given input is returned in the orbit, it does not belong to the K3, but to the ambient projective space. Try something like

[u.parent() for u in orbit]

With correct input, that works just fine for me.  The problem looks to me like it lies in the doctest not in the code:


```
sage: X = WehlerK3Surface([Z, Y])
sage: T = PP(0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0)
```


Notice that the doctest is mistakenly defining the initial point on the ambient space and not the K3 surface.


Your fix does prevent this bad input problem. That is what you're trying to fix?

Well, in #22649, I am painfuly trying to modernize (for python3) the comparison of scheme morphisms. This triggered a doctest failure in WehlerK3, that I tracked to the fact the the parent of orbit[0] was not the same as the parent of the last element of the orbit.

So I guess I do not mind the way we fix it here : either by fixing the initial point in the doctest or by using this self(copy(Q)) in the code (or even both..)

I also made the small tweak to the one doc test.
