Assignee: jason, was

Some approaches to teaching linear algebra define nonsingular matrices before broaching matrix invertibility.  This will just add nonsingular as a pseudonym for invertible, with some changes to the associated documentation.  thus making it a bit easier for Sage usage to follow one possible development of the topic.

Do you think it might be better to add the positive phrasing, m.is_singular(), rather than the negative nonsingular version?

I had that thought.

I guess the other philosophy at play here is that typically, is_* functions determine what an object *is*, not what it is not.  There probably are exceptions, though...

It is never what it seems.  Over a commutative ring, the **right** thing to do is to define `is_singular()` to be the condition that the matrix has a zero determinant.

So this needs to be a new method, it is better stated as the positive version, and it is more than just a convenience.
