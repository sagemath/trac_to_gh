```sage
sage: E = EllipticCurve(QQbar, [1,0])
sage: E.multiplication_by_m_isogeny(1).rational_maps()
(x, -y)
```



```sage
sage: E = EllipticCurve(GF(127), [1,0])
sage: P = E.random_point()
sage: E.multiplication_by_m_isogeny(5)(P)
(15 : 56 : 1)
sage: 5*P
(15 : 71 : 1)
sage: -5*P
(15 : 56 : 1)
sage: E.multiplication_by_m(5) == (-E.multiplication_by_m_isogeny(5)).rational_maps()
True
```


It isn't *consistently* wrong:


```sage
sage: E = EllipticCurve(QQ, [1,0])
sage: E.multiplication_by_m_isogeny(1).rational_maps()
(x, y)
```

Based on your description, it seems like the thing to do would be to make #32388 a dependency since it generally seems to be better. You can then use this ticket as motivation for #32388 if that is necessary.

I was worried that #32388 might take a while to get in, which could cause this (in principle, totally unrelated) bug to remain unfixed for no good reason if there was a dependency. Hence why I figured the best way to proceed would be to first apply this minimal bugfix and pursue the longer-term solution based on `EllipticCurveHom` later.
