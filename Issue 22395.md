I Travis,

I'm curious, is there any performance gain. I had the impression that storing everything in python dict simply kills all possibilities of optimization ? 

We discussed during past sage days, to re-implement combinatorial free modules, using arrays with a global dict for all object used only during input and output and not during linear algebra.

There seems to be a little bit with doing basic operations:

```
sage: C = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, [1,2,3])
sage: x = sum(C.basis())
sage: %timeit [x + x for _ in range(1000)]
100 loops, best of 3: 2.57 ms per loop
```

vs old:

```
sage: C = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, [1,2,3])
sage: x = sum(C.basis())
sage: %timeit [x + x for _ in range(1000)]
100 loops, best of 3: 2.94 ms per loop
```

While it's not much, it is something like a 10-15% speedup, but it is something likely to be called a significant number of times. It's even more so for scalar multiplication:

```
sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(ZZ).s()
sage: x = s.an_element()
sage: %timeit [4*x for _ in range(1000)]
100 loops, best of 3: 2.49 ms per loop
```

vs old:

```
sage: %timeit [4*x for _ in range(1000)]
100 loops, best of 3: 3.42 ms per loop
```

I might even be able to get some more speed if I am smarter in how we create the results of, e.g., `_add_`.

That gives a very nice speed boost:

```
sage: C = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, [1,2,3])
....: x = sum(C.basis())
....: %timeit [x + x for _ in range(1000)]
....: 
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.84 ms per loop
sage: s = SymmetricFunctions(ZZ).s()
sage: x = s.an_element()
sage: %timeit [4*x for _ in range(1000)]
100 loops, best of 3: 2.05 ms per loop
```

Now those Python calls become relatively expensive, so we should avoid them.

Plausibly the explanation around that change needs to be updated a bit: there remains no "normal" attribute in this example. Maybe `el.foo=1` could be issued before, and a comment added after that `_monomial_coefficients` is a Cython attribute?

In general, this seems to be calling for changing the running example for this tutorial. The current one is a bit complicated. But that's for a later ticket.

About `_divide_if_possible_`: since we are moving it anyway, shall we use the occasion to put it somewhere meaningful? Maybe as a method in EuclideanDomains, as `x._divide_if_possible(r)`, next to `quo_rem` which it depends on?

Please also add a brief comment and trac ref for the `unpickle_override`
at the end of the file.

Comment by nthiery created at 2017-05-16 15:50:20

Could you elaborate a bit why we need `CombinatorialFreeModule.Element` to be a subclass of `IndexedFreeModuleElement`? In particular, can you provide a minimal non-working example?

# TODO: move the content of this class to CombinatorialFreeModule.Element and ModulesWithBasis.Element

Comment by nthiery created at 2017-05-16 15:59:31

I am wondering whether the printing methods (_sorted_items_for_printing, latex, repr, asciiart, ...) should be moved to `Modules.WithBasis.ElementMethods`. We are moving them anyway, and I believe they would be a reasonable default implementation. That would require providing a default value for `parent._print_options` though, and deciding for a generic idiom to run through the items.

What do you think?

We could also keep that for a later ticket.


---

Comment by nthiery created at 2017-05-16 16:11:36

Instead of `sage.modules.with_basis.indexed_free_module_element`, we could use the shorter `sage.modules.with_basis.element`. That would be consistent with the nearby `morphism` module.
I don't foresee other element classes in this module that would not be element classes for `IndexedFreeModule`.


---

Comment by nthiery created at 2017-05-16 16:14:56

Users will have code importing `CombinatorialFreeModuleElement`. We should support them with a deprecation alias "Please use `CombinatorialFreeModule.Element` or `IndexedFreeModuleElement`."

If we wan't to be even kinder to our users, helping them prepare for the next step, we could have `sage.modules.with_basis.indexed_free_module.IndexedFreeModule` (or just `.free_module.`?) be an alias for `CombinatorialFreeModuleElement`. Then the above message warning would suggest `IndexedFreeModule.Element`.

- comment:15 I added a comment. Feel free to change. I also agree that a tutorial update should be done on a separate ticket.
- comment:16 I had separated that in order to track down a bug ([4ee3313](https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git/commit/?id=4ee3313767ce3b3be2f7b5a8f5938d0d6c3e0edc)).
- comment:18 Good point. Done
- comment:19 I feel these are basically useless to repeating what the code makes (more) clear, but added.
- comment:20 This doesn't work with any subclasses where you need a `_mul_` from the category. Change it and try to multiply two symmetric group algebra elements for example:
  {{{
sage: SymmetricGroupAlgebra(QQ, 3)
Symmetric group algebra of order 3 over Rational Field
sage: prod(_.algebra_generators())
...
TypeError: 'NotImplementedType' object is not callable
  }}}
  There were also pickling issues.
- comment:21 Done.
- comment:22 -1 as that is a little too close to enforcing elements being printed as sums, which is not what we want.
- comment:23 I changed the file name to `indexed_element` as `element` is too generic for my tastes, but I left the class name the same.
- comment:24 Done, but I slightly disagree with needing a deprecation because it was never imported into the global namespace. However, it was in the (public) doc, so it is good to have it. At this point, I think we should reference both and let the user decide.

Thanks; I did a second pass on it. Good to go.

> - comment:22 -1 as that is a little too close to enforcing elements being printed as sums, which is not what we want.

I see it as merely providing a sane default which works generically
but can be overridden at will. Anyway, that's admittedly out of scope
for this ticket; we can decide later on.

Sounds good.

Yup, exactly.

Ok!

Out of curiosity, I am now going to have a quick look at the inheritance thing of
comment:20. Other than that, it's good to go; thanks for all the hard
work!

Advantage of the above commit:
- A bit simpler: no distinction anymore between `CFF.Element` and `IndexedFreeModuleElement`. In particular there is no risk to have someone use directly IndexedFreeModule without inheriting from it.
- Avoids a double inheritance, with CFF.element_class deriving from CFF.Element itself deriving from `IndexedFreeModuleElement`

Inconvenient:
- requires to override element_class

I believe it's worth it. What do you think?

Comment by tscrim created at 2017-05-18 19:30:56

I am not so convinced as it hides a fault in a non-trivial way; it something that we should not need to do. I do agree it is more simple. Nevertheless, one should typically use a subclass of the `CFM.Element` when subclassing `CFM` and needing a new element class if they want to use the same data structures. Although I don't think there is too much difference between our two hacks.

Also, in some ways it almost looks like you are moving the unpickling to a completely unrelated class since

```
register_unpickle_override("sage.combinat.free_module",
                           "CombinatorialFreeModuleElement",
                           CombinatorialFreeModule.Element)
```

If you want the `__setstate__` in `IndexedFreeModuleElement`, then this `register_unpickle_override` should redirect to that.

Ok. I agree, it's minor anyway.

Good point. Fixed. This prompted me to move the
`register_unpickle_overide` next to `IndexedFreeModuleElement`.

Sorry for the forced-push; I had screwed up my commit just before.

Altogether, I believe this is good to go!

Comment by nthiery created at 2017-05-19 00:06:09

The former probably comes from a parent whose categories are not initialized.

Replying to [comment:45 nthiery]:
> The former probably comes from a parent whose categories are not initialized.

The problem comes from the fact that Laurent polynomials are not in Euclidean domains. There are also a number of natural rings that are not Euclidean domains, but have a `quo_rem` that we could at least try this with (e.g., *Z*[x]). So I'm thinking of demoting it back down from the category.


---

Comment by nthiery created at 2017-05-19 02:35:15

I just found out the same :-)
Yeah, either demoting it back down, or lifting it up to Rings(). After all, it's a private method. So if it fails because it requires another method which is not implemented, that's ok. At least it will be easier to discover than if it's hidden in some random Python module. It's consistent with FreeModule's requirement of taking a ring as input.


---

Comment by nthiery created at 2017-05-19 02:44:51

For the other failure: it stems from the fact that the created element
class's name is set to reflect that it's the element class of a given
parent:

```
sage: A = Algebras(QQ).WithBasis().example()
sage: A.element_class
<class 'sage.combinat.free_module.FreeAlgebra_with_category.element_class'>
```


However the work is half baked, since the module is not set
accordingly: there is no class
`sage.combinat.free_module.FreeAlgebra`; the module part comes from
`CombinatorialFreeModuleElement.__module__` (I am running this example
without the ticket). With the `...Element` being moved, the module
part gets changed to `sage.modules.with_basis.indexed_element`.

Two options:
- Not care and just update the doctests
- Improve the output of the element class by setting the module of the
  parent as module.

I just implemented the latter to check that it worked. The end result
is more consistent for the user; here we get:

```
<class 'sage.categories.examples.algebras_with_basis.FreeAlgebra_with_category.element_class'>
```


However changing `__module__` might possibly break some introspection
stuff (I checked `A.element_class??`, and that was fine). It will also
require updating other doctests.

What do you think?

I think lifting it up to the category of `Rings` works for now.

This seems to be a can of worms. :/ Although I would rather have the latter as well since it is a more proper fix. Since you've done it, we might as well keep it.

Arg, the exact same `_mul_` mistake has appeared a couple days ago in some other ticket.

I'll set back a positive review when the pdf doc compilation will be finished, in case there wouldbe something else.

Thanks Volker for reporting ...

The only other error I get is:

And I assume this is related to an outdate latex install on my machine:

```
[docpdf] Package sphinx Warning:

```


So, putting this back to positive review. Travis, can you double check things compile on your machine?

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2017-07-13 08:14:20

Question: what exactly is the purpose of the condition involving `is_extension_type()` in `__make_element_class__`?

I am trying to understand how/why `is_extension_type` is used in Sage. In other places in `parent.pyx`, it is to determine whether `__class__` can be assigned to. But in `__make_element_class__`, it's not so clear to me.

(I know it's not directly related to this ticket, but `git blame` brought me here since this ticket made changes to `__make_element_class__`)


---

Comment by nthiery created at 2017-07-13 14:56:53

Hi Jeroen!

In ``__make_element_class__``, we need to decide how elements shall inherit from categories: either by subclassing ``P.Element`` (or the relevant class), or by using the ``getattr`` trick. The current rule is to subclass if ``P.Element`` is a Python class, and use ``getattr`` if ``P.Element`` is an extension type. ``is_extension_type`` is used to do the test.

Thanks. That answers the factual question ("how is it done?") but not really the reason.

There are many differences between Python and Cython classes and I'm trying to understand which property matters here. I am asking because I tried to _always_ use the dynamic class (using `inherit=True` in `__make_element_class__` even for Cython element classes) and there is not much that breaks.

These are the main differences between Python and Cython classes that I can think of:

1. The fact that `__class__` can be assigned to for Python classes (I don't think this is the reason here)

2. The fact that Python classes have a `__dict__` (this is no longer true: Python classes with `__slots__` don't have a `__dict__` by default and Cython classes do support `__dict__` if you declare it as attribute)

3. The fact that Python classes always support multiple inheritance, which may or may not work for Cython classes

4. Pickling (although Cython 0.26 does support pickling of Cython classes)

5. Various performance differences

6. ...

To elaborate on this: after making this change

I ran all doctests in `rings`, `categories` and `structure` and the only non-trivial doctest failures were involving enumerated sets (`src/sage/categories/examples/infinite_enumerated_sets.py`, `src/sage/categories/sets_cat.py`, `src/sage/categories/enumerated_sets.py`)

Hi Jeroen,

Thanks for running this interesting experiment!

I indeed would have been expecting things not too break too much. Systematically using dynamic classes would certainly simplify Sage's infrastructure. The only potential reason for not doing it is performance (speed and memory footprint). At the time we set this up, there was some consensual claim that systematically using a dynamic class would induce a performance loss for low granularity objects (e.g. finite field elements). Hence the above rule of thumb I implemented for deciding when to do what.

However I don't remember anyone doing some serious benchmarking to actually assess the validity of that claim. That would be very welcome! And this hints again at having some speed-regression test infrastructure for Sage.

Cheers,
                   Nicolas

PS: I could imagine code breaking in situations like:

```
cdef class MyElement:
    ....

cdef foo(MyElement x):
    x.bar()
```


where `foo` would be called on an instance of a dynamic subclass of `MyElement`, and `foo` be provided by some category.

Apparently we have no instance of that idiom in Sage :-)

Comments on this actual ticket: contrary to most element classes which are implemented in Cython, it seems that `CombinatorialFreeModule_with_category.element_class` actually does do the inheritance from the category in the "normal" way, using `dynamic_class()`, just like Python classes. So this is a good testcase for #23435.

In the light of #23435, is it important that `CombinatorialFreeModule_with_category.element_class` has a `__dict__`? In other words, is it important to support the following (example taken from `src/doc/en/thematic_tutorials/tutorial-objects-and-classes.rst`):

```
Some particular actions modify the data structure of ``el``::

    sage: el.rename("bla")
    sage: el
    bla

.. note::

    The class is stored in a particular attribute called ``__class__``,
    and the normal attributes are stored in a dictionary called ``__dict__``::

        sage: F = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, Permutations())
        sage: el = 3*F([1,3,2])+ F([1,2,3])
        sage: el.rename("foo")
        sage: el.blah = 42
        sage: el.__class__
        <class 'sage.combinat.free_module.CombinatorialFreeModule_with_category.element_class'>
        sage: el.__dict__
        {'__custom_name': 'foo',
         'blah': 42}
```

Another question about this ticket: why are the arithmetic methods of `IndexedFreeModuleElement` implemented as `cdef` instead of `cpdef`?

```
    cdef _add_(self, other):
```

Every other class (except for `IndexedFreeModuleElement` and `LieAlgebraElement`) implements those as `cpdef _add_`.

This is confusing because

```
sage: F = CombinatorialFreeModule(QQ, Permutations())
sage: el = 3*F([1,3,2])+ F([1,2,3])
sage: el._add_(el)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-31-91def7298b70> in <module>()
----> 1 el._add_(el)

TypeError: 'NotImplementedType' object is not callable
```


It also prevents a Python class inheriting from `IndexedFreeModuleElement` to override this `_add_`.

That is not quite true. They are `cdef` in `Element`, and so I followed suit. I see now in the doc for `Element`, that it says it should be `cpdef`. Is it because `Element` is special in that they are essentially acting as pure virtual methods that they aren't `cpdef`?

Yes, the `Element` base class is special. The arithmetic methods of `Element` do indeed act as "pure virtual" methods. I implemented them that way to allow fast calling in the Cython world while at the same time not existing in the Python world.
