# The computation of b below hangs.

q=49
F.<E>=CyclotomicField(q)
G = F['z,w'].fraction_field()
[z,w]=G.gens()

denom = (E-E^22)*(E-E^27)
print denom
print

recip=1/denom
print recip
print

a=w*recip
print a
print

b=w/denom
print b
print

recip=1/denom
print recip
print

a=w*recip
print a
print

b=w/denom
print b
```

*The attempt to evaluate b=w/denom hangs. But the reciprocal of the denominator is not complicated: Sage has no trouble evaluating recip=1/denom and then a=w*recip.*

*Note that z is not involved in this computation, just in the definition in the field of rational functions.*

Can you reproduce the hang in the new Singular?

It's the same with #14333.

Ok. Then I will not ask for a doctest! If it had been fixed then perhaps a doctest would be useful. Is it ok if we don't try to fix both the hang and noninterruptible nature of the code here?

The hang can be fixed in a later ticket (with upstream report) since it depends on a fix in Singular, whereas on the Sage side it is more important that we ensure that it can be interrupted.

Works for me:

Meanwhile (sage 7.6 beta 4) the example finishes in a bit and seems correct.
Needs a test and then a review?
