# The computation of b below hangs.

q=49
F.<E>=CyclotomicField(q)
G = F['z,w'].fraction_field()
[z,w]=G.gens()

denom = (E-E^22)*(E-E^27)
print denom
print

recip=1/denom
print recip
print

a=w*recip
print a
print

b=w/denom
print b
print

recip=1/denom
print recip
print

a=w*recip
print a
print

b=w/denom
print b
```

_The attempt to evaluate b=w/denom hangs. But the reciprocal of the denominator is not complicated: Sage has no trouble evaluating recip=1/denom and then a=w*recip._

_Note that z is not involved in this computation, just in the definition in the field of rational functions._

Can you reproduce the hang in the new Singular?

It's the same with #14333.

Ok. Then I will not ask for a doctest! If it had been fixed then perhaps a doctest would be useful. Is it ok if we don't try to fix both the hang and noninterruptible nature of the code here?

The hang can be fixed in a later ticket (with upstream report) since it depends on a fix in Singular, whereas on the Sage side it is more important that we ensure that it can be interrupted.

Works for me:


```
sage: F.<a>=CyclotomicField(49); G = F['z,w'].fraction_field(); 1/G(a^28 + a^23 - 1)
(680161/4485167*a^41 - 1808464/4485167*a^40 + 183965/4485167*a^39 - 1904126/4485167*a^38 - 427226/4485167*a^37 - 1928114/4485167*a^36 + 885906/4485167*a^35 - 778361/4485167*a^34 - 162589/4485167*a^33 - 324303/4485167*a^32 - 632185/4485167*a^31 - 817800/4485167*a^30 - 1123149/4485167*a^29 + 384188/4485167*a^28 - 793121/4485167*a^27 + 867518/4485167*a^26 - 937329/4485167*a^25 + 488348/4485167*a^24 - 1850813/4485167*a^23 + 219604/4485167*a^22 + 1035482/4485167*a^21 + 808745/4485167*a^20 - 1148406/4485167*a^19 + 1017389/4485167*a^18 - 1061865/4485167*a^17 - 731354/4485167*a^16 - 1028349/4485167*a^15 + 112924/4485167*a^14 - 465812/4485167*a^13 - 1406657/4485167*a^12 + 81895/4485167*a^11 - 1718038/4485167*a^10 - 236022/4485167*a^9 - 1681906/4485167*a^8 + 1257081/4485167*a^7 - 988840/4485167*a^6 + 895391/4485167*a^5 - 921705/4485167*a^4 + 207460/4485167*a^3 - 1770753/4485167*a^2 - 353913/4485167*a - 1546685/4485167)

Agreed, it actually doesn't hang, just takes an extraordinary large amount of time:

```
sage: %time F.<a>=CyclotomicField(49); G = F['z,w'].fraction_field(); 1/G(a^28 + a^23 + 1)
CPU times: user 0.02 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.02 s
Wall time: 0.02 s
```


```
sage: %time F.<a>=CyclotomicField(49); G = F['z,w'].fraction_field(); 1/G(a^28 + a^23 - 1)
CPU times: user 11.64 s, sys: 0.06 s, total: 11.70 s
Wall time: 11.72 s
```

Still needs to be fixed :)

Meanwhile (sage 7.6 beta 4) the example finishes in a bit and seems correct.
Needs a test and then a review?
