CC:  roed

But only override `_richcmp_` instead.

Overwriting `__richcmp__` used to be necessary to override `__hash__`. This is not the case anymore it seems.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23485

These blocks of code should go away:

```
        if not isinstance(other, RingHomomorphism_cover):
            return (op == Py_NE)
```


I disagree with them in the first place and they are just pointless now.

Sorry, I was wrong. At least some of the type checks are still needed, because equal parents does not imply equal types here. For example:

```
sage: R.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(QQ, 2)
sage: S.<a,b> = R.quo(x^2 + y^2)
sage: phi = S.cover()
sage: alpha = R.hom(R, (0,0))
sage: psi = phi.pre_compose(alpha)
sage: parent(psi) is parent(phi)
True
sage: type(psi) is type(phi)
False
