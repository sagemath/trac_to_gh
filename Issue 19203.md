With the recent change in the cluster code,

```
sage: Q= ClusterQuiver(['D',4])
sage: hash(Q)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: <class 'sage.combinat.cluster_algebra_quiver.quiver.ClusterQuiver'> is not hashable
```

And this has very bad consequences !

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19440

Your changes look fine to me. In general, I am worried that the code gets slower and slower... I would like to do a few tests whether this also applies to your proposed changes.
