Replying to [comment:16 aly.deines]:
>  I thought I only needed to run make when spkg changed

That is still true.

However: most of the time this spkg change is implicit when changing branches. When you move from a branch based on one Sage version to a branch based on a different Sage version, chances are high that some spkg has changed between those branches.

> Should I more generally run make?

At least when changing branches, yes. Once you did this and you then make changes only to the Sage library, then `./sage -b` should be sufficient. But run `make` when in doubt.

Note that you can also use `make build` instead of `make` to skip the documentation build which can take a while.
