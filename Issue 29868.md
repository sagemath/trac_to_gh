`sage.libs.ecl` exposes no Python function that converts a Python string to a Lisp string as an `EclObject`. 

(`python_to_ecl`, which is used by ``EclObject.__init__`, handles strings by `READ`ing from them, so `EclObject("abc")` returns an interned symbol, not a string.)

We add a Python function `ecl_make_simple_string` to fill this gap.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30105

In fact, perhaps it would also make sense to add an optional argument to `python_to_ecl` and `EclObject.__init__` that controls whether Python strings (which may also be nested in lists etc.) are merely converted (using the new function) or `READ` from.

how about making use of things like `ecl_to_double()` to send data between Python and Maxima?

This is the opposite direction of conversion, and these functions are already used in `ecl_to_python`.

This works but the unicode handling needs to be improved.

```
sage: from sage.libs.ecl import *
sage: fire = EclObject('ðŸ”¥', False)
sage: fire
<ECL: "ðŸ”¥">
sage: _length = ecl_eval('''#'length''')
sage: _length(fire)
<ECL: 4>
sage: _type_of = ecl_eval('''#'type-of''')
sage: _type_of(fire)
<ECL: (SIMPLE-ARRAY BASE-CHAR (4))>
```
