Keywords: detect_poles, excluded point

The following plot has a (big) gap around x = 0.

```
sage: plot(x, -1, 1, detect_poles=True, plot_points=30)
Launched png viewer for Graphics object consisting of 2 graphics primitives
```

The problem is that `detect_poles` uses 0 for the default value of `exclusion_point`. To fix this, we need a default value that is not in the plotting interval. (For example, we can add 1 to the right endpoint of the interval.)
