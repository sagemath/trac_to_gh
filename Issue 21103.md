CC:  leif

Sage says that the Boolean lattice of `2^3=8` elements is not [meet|join]-semidistributive. This is propably due to division by `2` that is not preparsed and was hence missed in my tests.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/21340

This is a *massive* hack solution that comes from this behavior:

```sage
sage: log(8, 2)

sage: log(8, int(2))
log(8)/log(2)
sage: log(int(8), int(2))
log(8)/log(2)

If we are to accept this hack, we should well document it as such.

The biggest thing is just documenting why we are doing certain things, so when we go back and look again or someone else comes and looks at it, it is clear why things were done this way.

One option would be wrapping the inequality test in `bool(...)`. This evaluates the symbolic expression to a boolean and doesn't affect boolean values:

```
sage: bool(13 > 8 * log(8, 2) / 2)
True
sage: bool(12 > 8 * log(8, 2) / 2)
False
sage: bool(True)
True
sage: bool(False)
False
```

Again, there should be a comment. Another option would be to do `log(8,2).n()`, which could introduce some numerical noise. Or just force both values to `ZZ`.

N() wasn't the problem, but (also) rounding:

(s is 12 here.)

sage: n*log(n, 2)
24
sage: n*log(n, 2r)
8*log(8)/log(2)
sage: N(n*log(n, 2r))
24.0000000000000
sage: 2*s < n*log(n, 2)
False
sage: 2*s > n*log(n, 2)
False
sage: 2*s > n*log(n, 2r)
24 > 8*log(8)/log(2)
sage: bool(2*s > n*log(n, 2r))
True
sage: bool(2r*s > n*log(n, 2r))
True
sage: bool(2r*s > n*log(n, 2))
False
sage: 24 > N(n*log(n, 2r))
True
```


So I'd suggest to rewrite the code, and/or call the proper `log()`, or (first) check whether `n` is a power of 2.

If you just want to know *whether* `n` is an exact power of two (<=> n==0 or popcnt(n)==1), you can use `n & ~(n-1) == n`.

You could likewise use Python's `math.log(int(n), 2)`, or various functions from GMP (since Sage Integers are based on `mpz_t`).

Probably not for true powers of 2; don't know why Sage's log() is so bad in that regard.  (How large does `n`, or  `log(n, 2)`, practically get?)

FWIW, if you want to stay in the integer domain, you could as well use `4`<sup>`s`</sup>`> n`<sup>`n`</sup>, where the right-hand side is as cheap as the left if (`n` is sufficiently small or `ctz(n)` is relatively large or) `n` is a power of 2.

But that's perhaps already towards bike-shedding.

\\

Especially if you know `n` is a power of 2, you could do appropriate rounding as well, but I'd rather fix log() or use a different one.

But doesn't already using `sage.misc.functional.log(n, Integer(2))` solve (or, more precisely, work around) the main problem here?

OK, should work now. Also function name changed.

Doesn't the latter require a deprecation of the old function first?

Yes.  The first (I think) being `.is_complemented(self)`, but there are more IIRC.

`certify`, `prove[_if_(true|false)]`, `[return_]witness[_if_false]`?  ;-)

(I guess you were referring to `is_...()`, not the keyword argument, though.)

I'd rather keep the `is_...()`, but add (a) keyword or boolean argument(s), and only change the return type(s).

But then you'd have to first make the old behaviour the default, for backwards compatibility.

I can think those later in another ticket. Actually there is more to think about in splitting code in `posets.py` and `lattices.py` vs. `hasse_diagram.py`.

But is there more to do for this ticket?

`exact_log` rounds down, my helper function rounds up. Of course I could use it, but the code would not be much simpler. Waiting for Python 3 and log_2...

But I think that someone, "FrÃ©dÃ©ric" if I remember the name correctly, is converting [SageMath](SageMath) to Python 3. `:=)` Then we will have `math.log2()`.
