This is a common issue especially when using libtool to link Windows DLLs and should hopefully be straightforward to fix.

The `-no-undefined` is only needed when building a shared library, so the flag can be appended in e.g.


```
libfoo_la_LDFLAGS = -no-undefined
```


rather than the global


```
AM_LDFLAGS=-no-undefined
```


that will affect all link operations (including executables). It probably doesn't hurt much, but I remember vaguely that `--as-needed` was nicer than `--no-undefined` if you were going to apply it globally.

I also think most projects should have `LT_INIT([disable-static])` in configure.ac these days, to disable the static libraries by default. They can still be enabled with `--enable-static`, but for most people they're a waste of time/space.

> I also think most projects should have `LT_INIT([disable-static])` in configure.ac these days, to disable the static libraries by default. They can still be enabled with `--enable-static`, but for most people they're a waste of time/space.

I agree, but I want to keep the upstream patches minimal. We have #28890 for the task of sending `--disable-static` to all our packages

Yes, it's a trick that I have been using recently. The URL shows in ticket lists such as https://trac.sagemath.org/report/92?asc=1&page=1 and this reminds me (or other developers) to inspect these automatic builds when they are done.

They will be replaced by actual reviewer names when ready.

The build on Cygwin takes very long because of various overheads compared to a build on Linux. On GH Actions there is a time limit of 6 hours per job. Therefore I have split the build into several jobs ("stages"), some of which run in parallel. The linked build https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/actions/runs/285244461 is the `cygwin-standard` build, which means that I install binary packages from the Cygwin distribution first and then start the build of Sage.

`stage-i-a` and `stage-i-b` ran in parallel and succeeded. What they install in `SAGE_LOCAL` is carried forward to `stage-ii`. The 5 jobs `stage-ii-a` to `stage-ii-e` all ran in parallel, building various packages. 

As you observed, `stage-ii-a` failed because of `scipy`. This is a bug unrelated to the present ticket; it is tracked in #30643. 
Unfortunately this bug blocks the following stages (`stage-iii` would go on to build the Sage library), and so because of this we cannot really check that the current ticket is working correctly.

We seem to be in short supply of these...

I have modified the CI script so that the scipy failure does not stop the whole build.

The resulting build logs (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/suites/1285136303/artifacts/20016238) show that `cliquer`, `giac`, `meataxe`, and `rw`, i.e., all packages mentioned in the ticket description except for `libbraiding` (for which the branch contains an update) and `singular` (for which the branch does not contain a change) are OK now. 
Some optional packages were not built previously. In total, we now have the following remaining issues:
