This file hasn't seen much love since 2009. I've added the proper notation for the symbols, fixed the definition of the Gaunt coefficient and conformed symbol names to Edmonds.

Ralf, could you please have a look at this ticket so that it makes it into 7.3? The changes are cosmetic apart from putting 3-j symbols into the definition of the Gaunt coefficient. Thanks!

I only found this issue, could you please address it:
* `sage.functions.wigner.racah(aa, bb, cc, dd, ee, ff, prec=None)` but after INPUT reference is made to `a,...,f`

The LaTeX looks fine and you can set positive after the above change.

Since this ticket is about documentation, I made the displayed variables match those used in the code. The code could be updated to use more appropriate variables on another ticket.
