# Issue 10366: plot3d transformation documentation says 'independent' when it should be 'dependent'

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10367

Original creator: jason

Original creation time: 2010-12-02 09:50:58

Assignee: mvngu

Keywords: beginner

As pointed out on 

http://ask.sagemath.org/question/220/new-project-looking-for-help

the doctests for this function:

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/plot/plot3d/plot3d.html#sage.plot.plot3d.plot3d.Spherical

say:

"We can plot with this transform. Remember that the independent variable is the radius, and the dependent variables are the azimuth and the inclination (in that order):"

But it should read:

"We can plot with this transform. Remember that the dependent variable is the radius, and the independent variables are the azimuth and the inclination (in that order):"

The same problem occurs in the docs for http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/plot/plot3d/plot3d.html#sage.plot.plot3d.plot3d.Cylindrical

I noticed this too when working on Trac #10368. Patch is included. I checked that the doctests pass.
