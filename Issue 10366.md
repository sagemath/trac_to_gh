As pointed out on 

http://ask.sagemath.org/question/220/new-project-looking-for-help

the doctests for this function:

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/reference/sage/plot/plot3d/plot3d.html#sage.plot.plot3d.plot3d.Spherical

say:

"We can plot with this transform. Remember that the independent variable is the radius, and the dependent variables are the azimuth and the inclination (in that order):"

But it should read:

"We can plot with this transform. Remember that the dependent variable is the radius, and the independent variables are the azimuth and the inclination (in that order):"
