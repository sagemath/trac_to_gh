Getting the Python 3.8 support in #27754 merged in 9.2 will allow us to adopt the NEP 29 policy (https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html)

In this case we should indicate our intention to follow this policy  in our documentation.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30384

https://wiki.sagemath.org/ReleaseTours/sage-9.2#Support_for_Python_3.6.2C_3.8.2C_and_3.9_added
already declares the Sage 9.2 conforms to NEP 29.

I think the only thing missing is to add some sentences to the developer manual.

I don't think we need a vote. In general there seems to be limited interest in discussing release policies.

NEP 29 is actually quite explicit about that one should drop support after the 42 months, e.g "On Jun 23, 2020 drop support for Python 3.6 (initially released on Dec 23, 2016)". But that's, of course, only a recommendation (like everything in this NEP). It could be sage's policy to support also older python versions, but that's then no longer NEP 29 (in it's strict form). However, one should also keep in mind that supporting old Python versions results in technical debt that might be bigger than the gains from supporting old systems.

Also correct me if I'm wrong, but since sage is also installing its own python version, sage can still be used on older systems, right? It is just that the system python is not used.


Should I initiate a discussion on the mailing list, or do you want to do this?

The focus of NEP 29 is the deprecation of old Python versions. The idea is to have a community wide standard on when to drop support for old versions.

But I agree that this wasn't clear from the formulation so far. Changed the text and ticket description to hopefully clear up this confusion.
