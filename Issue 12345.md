# Issue 12345: EllipticCurve(E.a_invariants()) doesn't work

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: was

Assignee: cremona

At some point `E.a_invariants()` was changed to return a 5-tuple instead of a list of 5 numbers.  I have no idea why.  But this means that:

```
sage: E = EllipticCurve([1..5])
sage: EllipticCurve(E.a_invariants())
TypeError: invalid input to EllipticCurve constructor
```


Ugh.  Fix this, i.e., make the constructor take a tuple or a list.

See #4262 for the origin of this change, after a report by was (!) and #4264 by the patch which implemented it written mosstly by me.  As it says at that ticket, I did (of course) try to get the EllipticCurve constructor to accept tuples, but for some reason at the time I failed to get it to work.  So either you people are cleverer now than you or I were then, or other changes have made that easier.

Of course I approve of the change!

All my patch does is change an "isinstance(., list)" to "isinstance(., (list, tuple))" in one line.  That's it.  You worry me.

Don't worry, it was over 3 years ago and needed masses of doctest output changes which is the main thing I remember doing.  Looking at my old comments in #4264 it looks as if I was trying to change {{{__init__}} functions in classes instead of what you did.
