# Issue 29761: Corrupted elements after conversion in a tower of p-adic fields

In SageMath 9.1, do the following:

```
sage: K = Qp(2)
sage: R.<x> = K[]
sage: U.<u> = K.extension(x^2 + x + 1)
sage: L.<b> = U.extension(x^6 - 2)
sage: a = L.integer_ring()(K(2))
```

The element `a` now apparently has a corrupted internal representation:

```
sage: a - 2
<repr(<sage.rings.padics.relative_ramified_CR.RelativeRamifiedCappedRelativeElement at 0x7feaadc84af0>) failed: RuntimeError: repr_spec called on zero>
sage: 1/a
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: element has no inverse
```

Moving to 9.4, as 9.3 has been released.
