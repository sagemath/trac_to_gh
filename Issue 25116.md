Solve the `const void` in fflas with

```
$ sed -i s/INLINE\ CONST\ void/INLINE\ void/g $(find . -name "*inl")
```

I agree with the proposed fixes for fflas given here and the simple removal of the double template proposed on sage-devel by fidelbc and Dario Asprone. 
I have fixed both libraries upstream and add the corresponding patches to the branch for this ticket.

Don't forget to set to "needs review" if this is ready for review.
