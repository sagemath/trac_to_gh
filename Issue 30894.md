# Issue 30894: linux distribution contains uncleaned build directories

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31131

Original creator: culler

Original creation time: 2020-12-29 14:54:46

CC:  dunfield vbraun mjo jhpalmieri

Keywords: clean build

Over a third of the distribution archive
 sage-9.2-Ubuntu_20.04-x86_64.tar.bz2
is occupied by the build directory
 SageMath/build/pkgs/sagelib/src/build/



```
$ du -sh SageMath
13G	SageMath

$ du -sh SageMath/build/pkgs/sagelib/src/build/
4.8G	SageMath/build/pkgs/sagelib/src/build/
```


Perhaps a clean command got lost from one of the packaging scripts?

Changing priority from major to critical.

Note however that the "relocate-once.py" script needs at least some of what's in `build`.  If you delete `build` before the first run of sage, one gets:

```
nmd2 ~/SageMath $ ./sage

Rewriting paths for your new installation directory
===================================================

This might take a few minutes but only has to be done once.

Moving to 9.4, as 9.3 has been released.

Likewise in the Sage 9.4 binaries (except the build directory has moved to the new location `pkgs/sagemath-standard/build/`).

At least `pkgs/sagemath-standard/build/temp.*` should be removed (which is not needed for fast rebuilds). See related discussion in #33103.

Also (less importantly, because tiny)
- `pkgs/sage-docbuild/build` 


What is shipped in the binary distribution appears to be defined outside of the Sage source tree, in https://github.com/sagemath/binary-pkg/blob/master/sage.yaml#L35, not by any of the elaborate `...-clean` targets in our `Makefile`.
