# Issue 14238: Graph.is_circular_planar does not behave as expected

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14442

Original creator: ncohen

Original creation time: 2013-04-11 17:01:31

Assignee: jason, ncohen, rlm

As reported there https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-edu/ivWea0Gk3_Q/discussion

By the way, nobody would expect this {{{
sage: graphs.CompleteBipartiteGraph(3,2).is_circular_planar()
True
}}}

The same way that nobody would expect Sage to return "True" when `is_planar` is called on `K_5`. And this was one of the doctests `-_-`

Seems OK. Everything works as I expect it to work, the tests pass and the documentation is clearer. The only thing I was wondering about is the reference which says:  '[Online] Available: soon!' You might not now whether this is available in the meantime and where? I couldn't find anything.

I searched around and it does not seem to exist anywhere `:-/`

OK, that was also my conclusion. :-(

But that doesn't affect the validity of this patch.

Could you please check that this patch is correct ? I updated this cursed reference `[2]` to respect Sphinx' format.

Aaargh, I had expected `./sage -docbuild reference html` to summarise any errors encountered at the end. But I guess this is not the case. Luckily, I meanwhile discovered `./sage -docbuild reference/graphs html`. The rest is still the same, so OK for me.
