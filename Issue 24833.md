My attempt at a version which blends dual RSK together with RSK. Note the changes are relatively minimal.

Note to myself that (additionally!) adding dual RSK to `growth.py` is very easy.  It amounts to coding `F^2` and `B^2` on page 18 http://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~kratt/artikel/growth.html.  This should essentially be a copy-paste job, because `F^1` (as `RuleRSK.forward_rule`) and `F^4` (as `RuleBurge.forward_rule`) are already implemented.

Although this should be done, the proper solution would be #24659, which unfortunately turns out to be tricky.

Hi,
I am working on dualRSK and coRSK as part of my GSoC project(Ticket #28058). I have already migrated dualRSK but I am not able to find any reference for coRSK. Any help?

Don't worry, it's my own notation and everyone calls it differently. See the second solution to Exercise 2.7.12(a) in http://www.cip.ifi.lmu.de/~grinberg/algebra/HopfComb-sols.pdf or construction (1d) in Appendix A.4 of Fulton's Young tableaux book. You don't have to reimplement it as I haven't implemented it in the first place (this ticket only does dual RSK).

Changing keywords from "IMA coding sprint, combinatorics, tableaux, permutations" to "gsocRSK, IMA coding sprint, combinatorics, tableaux, permutations".

I'm currently trying to review the dual RSK and coRSK algorithms here, so I would rather not restrict the description of this ticket. The thing I'm likely to axe are the input checks (let's separate that concern out), not dual RSK.

I'm done with my review, but I assume it too needs to be reviewed. Travis, can you check it briefly against the already green #27852?

There is a docbuild failure reported on the patchbot, likely from these things:

```
    For more information, see Chapter 7, Section 14 in [Sta-EC2]_
    (where dual RSK is called RSK*) or the Third solution to
    Exercise 2.7.12(a) in [GR2018v5sol]_.
```


```
      a `\{0, 1\}`-matrix (i.e., a matrix whose entries are `0`s
      and `1`s).
```

and

```
        (namely, the lists `(j_0, j_1, \ldots, j_{\ell-1})` and
        `(k_0, k_1, \ldots, k_{\ell-1})` represent the generalized
        permutation
        ((j_0, k_0), (j_1, k_1), \ldots, (j_{\ell-1}, k_{\ell-1}))`)
```

In the first case, I would make it

```
    (where dual `\mathrm{RSK}` is called `\mathrm{RSK}^*`) or the third solution to
```

(also note that `Third` should not be capitalized) and the second, you need to have ``0`'s` and ``1`'s` as you cannot have the latex marker followed by a letter (Sphinx does not correctly interpret it as such). The third one is missing a backtick ``` in the last line.

Also, typo `reversel` -> `reversal`, `backwards CoRSK` -> `backwards coRSK`,

```diff
-    Checking that tableaux should be of same shape::
+    Checking that the tableaux should be of same shape::
```

and

```
construction (1d)) or the Second solution to Exercise 2.7.12(a) in
```

`Second` should also not be capitalized.

Done, thanks!

Now let's just wait for the patchbot. If that comes back (essentially) green, then this is a positive review.

Green patchbot. I just trivially fixed the pyflakes warnings, and I am allowing myself to set a positive review. Thank you all.
