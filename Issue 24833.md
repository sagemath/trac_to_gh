My attempt at a version which blends dual RSK together with RSK. Note the changes are relatively minimal.

Note to myself that (additionally!) adding dual RSK to `growth.py` is very easy.  It amounts to coding `F^2` and `B^2` on page 18 http://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~kratt/artikel/growth.html.  This should essentially be a copy-paste job, because `F^1` (as `RuleRSK.forward_rule`) and `F^4` (as `RuleBurge.forward_rule`) are already implemented.

Although this should be done, the proper solution would be #24659, which unfortunately turns out to be tricky.

Hi,
I am working on dualRSK and coRSK as part of my GSoC project(Ticket #28058). I have already migrated dualRSK but I am not able to find any reference for coRSK. Any help?

Don't worry, it's my own notation and everyone calls it differently. See the second solution to Exercise 2.7.12(a) in http://www.cip.ifi.lmu.de/~grinberg/algebra/HopfComb-sols.pdf or construction (1d) in Appendix A.4 of Fulton's Young tableaux book. You don't have to reimplement it as I haven't implemented it in the first place (this ticket only does dual RSK).

Changing keywords from "IMA coding sprint, combinatorics, tableaux, permutations" to "gsocRSK, IMA coding sprint, combinatorics, tableaux, permutations".
