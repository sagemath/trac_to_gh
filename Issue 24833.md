There is a docbuild failure reported on the patchbot, likely from these things:

```
    For more information, see Chapter 7, Section 14 in [Sta-EC2]_
    (where dual RSK is called RSK*) or the Third solution to
    Exercise 2.7.12(a) in [GR2018v5sol]_.

```
      a `\{0, 1\}`-matrix (i.e., a matrix whose entries are `0`s
      and `1`s).

and

```

        `(k_0, k_1, \ldots, k_{\ell-1})` represent the generalized
        permutation
        ((j_0, k_0), (j_1, k_1), \ldots, (j_{\ell-1}, k_{\ell-1}))`)

In the first case, I would make it

```
    (where dual `\mathrm{RSK}` is called `\mathrm{RSK}^*`) or the third solution to

(also note that `Third` should not be capitalized) and the second, you need to have ``0`'s` and ``1`'s` as you cannot have the latex marker followed by a letter (Sphinx does not correctly interpret it as such). The third one is missing a backtick ``` in the last line.

Also, typo `reversel` -> `reversal`, `backwards CoRSK` -> `backwards coRSK`,
