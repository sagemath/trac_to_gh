two things in `_ramgroups`

- remove the dot at the end of the input line

- add a link in the doc to `:pari:`idealramgroups``

Once fixed, you can set to positive

Reviewer patch containing the modifications suggested in comment:4 and a small change to `ramification_breaks()` that makes it more readable (in my opinion).
