# Issue 29333: Wrong parent when using diff_form of degree zero

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29570

Original creator: @mjungmath

Original creation time: 2020-04-24 22:22:02

CC:  egourgoulhon tscrim

Keywords: differential_forms


```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')
sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart()
sage: M.diff_form(0).parent()
Free module X(M) of vector fields on the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold M
```


This output is obviously wrong. The parent should represent the algebra of scalar fields instead. However, the element is correct:



```
sage: M.diff_form(0)
Scalar field on the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold M
```



While seeking the origin, I have encountered an issue even worse:


```
from sage.tensor.modules.finite_rank_free_module import FiniteRankFreeModule

sage: M = FiniteRankFreeModule(QQ, 3)
sage: M.alternating_form(0)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
KeyError                                  Traceback (most recent call last)
...
AttributeError: 'RationalField_with_category' object has no attribute 'element_class'
```


This should be fixed with this ticket.

I am assuming this change is a mistake:

Sure. I am sorry. Yesterday was late for me...

I removed the unnecessary line and also added a doctest to show that the error had been fixed.

Thanks for fixing this.
However, I don't think `self._ring._an_element_()` shall be used when `degree` is 0 in `FiniteRankFreeModule.alternating_form()`. Indeed, the method `_an_element()` returns a random element (for instance `1` in your example), whereas `alternating_form()` shall return a generic element, as it does for the degrees >= 1. 
Maybe a `try` with the `element_class` and `except` with the generic constructor of the base ring shall be better.

I agree, your suggestions sounds much better. Do arbitrary rings such as `ZZ` even provide constructors for generic elements?

However, in the first place, this issue occured due to the line


```
         return self.dual_exterior_power(degree).element_class(self, degree,
                                               name=name, latex_name=latex_name)
```


where `self` is definitely not the parent of the ring element. I would say, this is highly unstable since we cannot predict which arguments the element class actually takes and needs (for degree > 0 this is fine since we know which elements we deal with).

Indeed! Maybe an explicit scalar field construction (inside a try block) like you did for the non-free case is preferable then:

```
try:
    return self._domain.scalar_field(name=name, latex_name=latex_name)
except AttributeError: 
    return self._ring.an_element() # or something better...
```

Thinking about it, what about having the `except AttributeError` block do `raise NotImplementedError`? Sounds better than returning a random element...

Something like this?

I feel uncomfortable to add the special case of scalar fields to the most general case of modules over arbitrary ring. For that reason, I added this particular case to the vector field module.

Sounds better indeed.
Probably 

```
return self._ring.element_class(self, name=name,
                                latex_name=latex_name)
```

must be replaced by

```
return self._ring.element_class(self._ring, name=name,
                                latex_name=latex_name)
```

Then, do you really need to redefine `alternating_form` in `VectorFieldFreeModule`?

This is much better! Changed it.
