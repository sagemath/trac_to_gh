# Issue 28205: Trying to sign in to ask.sagemath.org with Google leads to 400 error

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28442

When I go to 

https://ask.sagemath.org/account/signin/

then click "Sign in with Google", I get a HTTP 400 (Bad Request) error (it goes to `https://ask.sagemath.org/account/signin/complete-oauth2`)

This happens even after clearing cookies for sagemath.org

Maybe this relied on Google+ which has now been discontinued.

Works alright now for me, are you still having that problem?

Not a big issue for me as I use password login. In fact, I misremembered that I had Google login setup.

Still, it should prompt to create a new account.

When I tried this yesterday, it just gave me an empty white page. Today, it works fine. The system seems to be a bit unreliable.
