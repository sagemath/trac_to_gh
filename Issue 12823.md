In Magma, one can do the following:

```
> Q := RationalField();
> P<x,y,z> := ProjectiveSpace(Q,2);
> L := LinearSystem(P,2);
> L;
Linear system on Projective Space of dimension 2
Variables : x, y, z
with 6 sections: x^2 x*y x*z y^2 y*z z^2
> p := P ! [3,2,1];
> L1 := LinearSystem(L,p);
> L1;
Linear system on Projective Space of dimension 2
Variables : x, y, z
with 5 sections:
x^2 - 9*z^2
x*y - 6*z^2
x*z - 3*z^2
y^2 - 4*z^2
y*z - 2*z^2
```

Sage does not have this functionality. This patch will be a first step towards adding a class LinearSystem to Sage.

The goal is to add a method _linear_system_as_kernel to projective spaces that returns a matrix whose kernel can be identified with the degree d hypersurfaces with multiplicity at least m at pt.

(I actually need this method in the context of equimultiple liftings of plane curves over finite fields for which I will open a separate ticket.)

The syntax

`raise Error, 'error message'`

has been deprecated in Python. http://docs.python.org/release/2.6.8/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions

We should use

`raise Error('error message')`

instead.

Hi!

I have a question: It says in the documentation part that the output is with respect to reverse lexicographic ordering of monomials. But it seems to me that, for example in the case of degree 2 in projective 2-space the monomials are ordered as:

`[x<sup>2,xy,xz,y</sup>2,yz,z^2]`

which seems to be just the lexicographic ordering rather than reverse lexicographic ordering.

If you agree I can incorporate this change into the review patch.

Hi David,

please excuse my slow response. I've recently left academia and can only find time to look at Sage in the evenings (but I am happy to do so!).

Thanks again for your comments. You are quite right, I've changed the documentation accordingly. I also saw where I got confused and changed one line of comment, too. :)
