# Issue 24862: Add DESTDIR support for sympow

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25099

Original creator: embray

Original creation time: 2018-04-04 07:27:45

CC:  slelievre

Keywords: destdir sympow

Implements #24024 and #23733 for sympow.

This one is a bit of an odd duck, and I left a lot of it alone.  But there were still a few areas where it could benefit from a bit of simplification.

embray: What's the status of sympow? Are we essentially the upstream maintainers of that package?

Not sure.

I was not able to locate a home page for the project or an issue tracker.

- The main author is Mark Watkins: http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/~watkins/
- Sympow binaries (currently Sympow 1.023): http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/~watkins/sympow.bz2
- Doc of [SageMath](SageMath) interface to Sympow: https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/lfunctions/sage/lfunctions/sympow.html

SageMath-the-distribution currently ships Sympow 1.018.1, while Debian
has been shipping Sympow 1.023 for a while.
SageMath trac ticket #3360 is about upgrading to Sympow 1.023.

Setting milestone to "sage-pending" since it has a dependency on a ticket that's not positively reviewed.

branch is red, needs rebase. And milestone may be changed now, maybe ?

That URL does not work for me. 404. Oh, I think you are missing a `.tar` here. The ones at #3360 actually work.

Debian's copyright file says:

```
The sympow package appears to be a maintained project but without official
 repository; version 1.023 was kindly provided via email by the upstream
 maintainer Mark Watkins <watkins@maths.usyd.edu.au>.
```


embray: Do you mind if I add some clarifications to the `SPKG.txt` about the state of this package or should I put this into a separate ticket?

Sorry, I got that wrong. The following links seem to respectively
get you archives with size and name:

- http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/~watkins/sympow
  -> 50 kB sympow.bz2
- http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/~watkins/sympow.src.tar.bz2
  -> 50 kB sympow.src.tar.bz2
- http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/~watkins/sympow.tar.bz2
  -> 8.6 MB sympow.tar.bz2

of which the first two are identical although named differently.

Changing status from needs_info to needs_review.

Comment by embray created at 2018-07-10 13:44:10

I think any discussion about the upstream status of this package is irrelevant to this ticket.  This is just a straight conversion of its `spkg-install` to properly support DESTDIR installation.

Ok. Then I'll put this into a separate ticket.

Comment by embray created at 2018-07-18 11:47:03

I believe this issue can reasonably be addressed for Sage 8.4.

This issue is fixed in the sympow fork at GitLab: https://gitlab.com/rezozer/forks/sympow
