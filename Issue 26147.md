> Maybe I should have kept CombinatorialObject ?

That one is a maybe. The biggest issue is they are no longer hashable:

```
sage: hash(NonDecreasingParkingFunction([]))
11648069979105038
```

which is an error on your branch. It is possible that someone is using the other list-like features of `CombinatorialObject` not already reimplemented (mainly the `__add__` being concatenation), but I find that highly unlikely.

Travis, do you think this could enter sage in the current state ? I would prefer not to spend more time on that..

I think it is probably better in the long run to not use `CombinatorialObject`. However, it does need a `__hash__`. Other than that, it is good to go.
