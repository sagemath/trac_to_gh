Hi Travis,

Here are further comments:

```
+ If we are construction a rigged configuration from a rigged configuration
+ (say of another type) and we don't want to recompute the vacancy numbers,
+ we can use the ``use_vacancy_numbers`` to avoid the recomputation.
```

This is not a sentence. Perhaps you want "If we are constructing"?

Also, it would be great to add left_split as a method to KirillovReshetikhinTableaux and possibly also the right_split method! This can be just done by using the bijection to rigged configurations, but it would be very handy to have these methods directly on KirillovReshetikhinTableaux as well.

Thanks,

Anne

Here's the major changes:

- Based this off #15882.

- Added the Luzstig involution to (tensor products of) KR tableaux, KR crystals, and rigged configurations.

- Added left/right splitting maps to (tensor products of) KR tableaux and rigged configurations. (The right splitting map is non-trivial on KR tableaux; look in type D<sub>4</sub><sup>(1)</sup> at the B<sup>2,2</sup> module generators.)

- Moved `opposition_automorphism()` from the crystals category into Cartan types.

- Fixed the typo noted above.

Hi Travis,

Here are some more comments:

* The documentation of right_split has a ` missing. Please run the documentation to see that it actually compiles!

* Please add the map `\theta` to rigged configuration and compare to lusztig_involution.

* Please add tests and more explanations what `build_graph` does. Explain which graph it is computing. Also the following fails:

I couldn't find this and the documentation built without an issue and looks okay to me (although there was a missing 'u').

Added under the name `complement`. In general, it will be different than `lusztig_involution`, which fixes each classical component, whereas `\theta` fixes the classical structure but permutes the classical components. Or did you mean you wanted me to add a doctest showing this?

There is a ` missing in

```
+ Let `\ast` denote the :meth:`Lusztig involution<lusztig_involution>`,
+ and `\mathrm{ls}` as the :meth:`left splitting map<left_split>`.
+ The right splitting map is defined as
+ \mathrm{rs} := \ast \circ \mathrm{ls} \circ \ast`.
```

Under `\bar \Phi` the map `\star` (which I guess is what you call lusztig_involution) intertwines with `\theta`. It would be good to add a check like that.

Even though it is stated in the documentation, that `build_graph` is an optional 
parameter, it does not seem to take this input:

```
sage: rc = RC(partition_list=[[1],[1],[1],[1]])
sage: rc.to_tensor_product_of_kirillov_reshetikhin_crystals(build_graph=True)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

----> 1 rc.to_tensor_product_of_kirillov_reshetikhin_crystals(build_graph=True)

TypeError: to_tensor_product_of_kirillov_reshetikhin_crystals() got an unexpected keyword argument 'build_graph'
```

What is the difference between `build_graph` and `display_steps`?

Ah, I forgot about the right split for KR tableaux. :P Fixed.

> Under `\bar \Phi` the map `\star` (which I guess is what you call lusztig_involution) intertwines with `\theta`. It would be good to add a check like that.

I've added a doctest.

This is because this was not a parameter in `to_tensor_product_of_kirillov_reshetikhin_crystals`, but in `*_tableaux`. I've also added the parameter (and doc/test) to the 'to TP of KR crystals' methods.

> What is the difference between `build_graph` and `display_steps`?

The first one constructs and returns the graph, the latter outputs each step to the terminal. I've changed `output` to `print` to avoid some ambiguity.

`right_split` is implemented as `* ls *` (where `*` is the Lusztig involution) for both rigged configurations and KR tableaux.
