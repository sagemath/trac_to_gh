Package exist on Arch and Fedora according to https://repology.org/project/coxeter/versions

It should be checked that all distributions that package the library install the headers with the same prefix `coxeter/`.

Currently we have in `src/module_list.py`:

```
    OptionalExtension('sage.libs.coxeter3.coxeter',
              sources = ['sage/libs/coxeter3/coxeter.pyx'],
              language="c++",
              include_dirs = [os.path.join(SAGE_INC, 'coxeter')],
              package = 'coxeter3'),
```


It should be checked whether we can get rid of `include_dirs` by changing `src/sage/libs/coxeter3/decl.pxd`.

This would simply the work in #29720.

coxeter3 builds on my system. So LGTM.

One of these days I will actually get back to converting coxeter3 to full C++ and doing some additional cleanup...
