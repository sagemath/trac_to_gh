**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/misc/persist.pyx", line 1018, in sage.misc.persist.picklejar
Failed example:
    if uid==0:
        raise OSError('You must not run the doctests as root, geez!')
    elif sys.platform == 'cygwin':
        raise OSError("This won't always behave on Cygwin depending on permission handling configuration.")
    else:
        sage.misc.persist.picklejar(1, dir + '/noaccess')
Expected:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    PermissionError: ...
Got:
    <BLANKLINE>
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/sage/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sage/doctest/forker.py", line 704, in _run
        self.compile_and_execute(example, compiler, test.globs)
      File "/sage/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sage/doctest/forker.py", line 1098, in compile_and_execute
        exec(compiled, globs)
      File "<doctest sage.misc.persist.picklejar[7]>", line 2, in <module>
        raise OSError('You must not run the doctests as root, geez!')
    OSError: You must not run the doctests as root, geez!
**********************************************************************
```


The patronizing message "You must not run the doctests as root" should be removed altogether

The failure is likely caused by the changes in #32326

The test suite *shouldn't* be run as root, but that's not the place to enforce it. Can you make that doctest save/restore the original permissions rather than setting them to 0755 unconditionally (which is too permissive)? Otherwise LGTM.
