# Issue 10008: PyOpenCL sage package (optional)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10009

Original creator: maldun

Original creation time: 2010-09-24 21:09:47

Assignee: maldun

CC:  leif

Keywords: opencl gpu programming

This package installs PyOpenCl (a nice GPU programming tool) from Andreas Kloeckner into Sage.

For more Info see http://mathema.tician.de/software/pyopencl

For installation:
 * Install OpenCL on your machine (This is contained for example in 
 CUDA for NVIDIA Cards: http://developer.nvidia.com/object/gpucomputing.html) or STREAM for ATI cards: http://developer.amd.com/gpu/atistreamsdk/pages/default.aspx; INTEL is not supported yet, but they announced it for 2011!)
 
 * Download the package at http://code.google.com/p/spkg-upload/downloads/detail?name=pyopencl-0.92.spkg 
(direct link: http://spkg-upload.googlecode.com/files/pyopencl-0.92.spkg)
 * install it.
 * IMPORTANT: After installation the setuptools package has to be reinstalled!! Because the installer uses the distributed egg package. This messes somehow with setuptools and will be removed after the installation. But this destroys setup tools! 
 * enjoy!

This is only tested on ubuntu 10.04 with latest nvidia development drivers (260.40) and CUDA toolkit 3.2 and SDK

I would appreciate some testing, and hope it's usefull

See also #10010 for an optional CUDA (PyCUDA) spkg.

*Remark:*
I changed 


```
cd $SAGE_LOCAL/LIB/python/site-packages
```


to


```
cd $SAGE_LOCAL/lib/python/site-packages
```


to make it possible to install this package on FEMhub also. The same applies for #10010

Setting spkg proposals that have not seen recent activity to "sage-wishlist".
