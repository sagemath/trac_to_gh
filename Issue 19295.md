My impression is that you implemented poles and still want to implement logarithmic singularities in the same ticket. I'd suggest to restrict this ticket to poles (and raising `NotImplementedError` for the logarithmic singularities, as apparently done in the current code) and to leave extensions to future tickets.

I reviewed the code, doctests pass, documentation and code are mostly fine. I added a few reviewer commits, please cross-review.

There is only the question on what to do with integral `alpha <= 0`. Currently, the result is `0` which is certainly correct for sufficiently large values of the parameter. However, the rest of the asymptotics code as I remember it does not really assume "sufficiently large values of the parameter".

I am not really sure which result is appropriate. Several options:
- `0` - valid for sufficiently large values of the parameter. (current version)
- `O(1)` - correct, but bad for applications.
- raise an error
- add a warning to the documentation
- add a note to the documentation

`zeta != 1` is not implemented.

I think the result should be `O(0)`. Currently I am thinking about an implementation of such a term and playing around a bit. If you want to get this ticket to positive, then I would raise a NotImplementedError at the moment. But give me a couple of days to figure out how `O(0)` would be possible.

Best, Daniel

What would `O(0)` mean? How would that affect #19944?

`f(n)` is in `O(0)` if there is an `N` such that `f(n)=0` for `n >= N`. Thus the coefficients of polynomials (seen as power series) would be in `O(0)`.

> How would that affect #19944?

E.g. inserting the generating function `(1-z)^alpha` for non-negative integers `alpha` would result in a `O(0)`, but this behavior comes from this ticket here. I am not sure if #19944 would need adaptions.

so `O(0)` would be smaller than any other element in the poset and be absorbed by any other error term? Would it live in some kind of `n^ZZbar` with `ZZbar = {- infinity} \cup ZZ`?

ok, may be.

The question is whether it is worth the effort. After working on #19944 I doubt that this generator here will frequently be called outside of #19944. After all, calling #19944 with a polynomial as an argument is erroneous anyway, because polynomials do not have singularities. Thus we should never have to return `O(0)` so we might as well go for a warning box here and be done with the problem.

I'm afraid, we would really need a growth of `0` to make it work correctly with cartesian products.

I am raising a special `NotImplementedError` now. Code follows...

LGTM. Setting to positive despite the dependency: the dependency is only in order to avoid a merge conflict (inserting new methods at the same position); so no changes are necessary here anyway independently of the fate of #19510.

Merge in #19898 to avoid a merge conflict. (Git is able to merge automatically if #19898 is handled first.)

Merged #19898 once more and added a doctest; please review this new doctest and then set to positive if satisfied.
