A _pre-release_ of PARI-2.5.3 has been released.  We don't plan to merge this in Sage, but we should be ready for the final PARI-2.5.3 release.

I am quite satisfied by this. Cannot comment on the cygwin patch but it has been approved elsewhere I believe.

Thanks for the review.  The Cygwin patch has indeed been reviewed already.
