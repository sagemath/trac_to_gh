This ticket implements sage.lattices.integer_lattice.IntegerLattice which represents a discrete subgroup of ZZ<sup>n</sup>.

This class is inspired by #15955 but except for the voronoi cell implementation, it is implemented anew from scratch.

This ticket also includes an updated interface to fpLLL which uses Cython's C++ features, uses the fpLLL 4.0 API and interfaces not only with LLL but also with fpLLL's BKZ and shortest vector enumeration.

Hi Martin!

You asked me to have a look at your code from the categorical point of view.

It really depends what you want to model.

Currently, you start on top of `SageObject`, which is about as basic as it can be. A `SageObject` hasn't even support for different categories. So, if for you a lattice is not more than an object, then it's fine.

A bit less basic is `CategoryObject`, which is for objects in arbitrary categories. In particular, it would be a suitable starting point for objects that do not have elements (i.e., whose category is not a sub-category of the category of sets). So, if you want that your lattice is a semigroup, but you do not want to implement elements of the semigroup, then it's fine---almost. AFAIK, it *is* mathematically possible to define the notion of a semigroup just in terms of morphisms and direct products, and it is not needed to refer to elements in the definition. However, Sage's category framework expects semigroups to be sets, and thus the `TestSuite` would complain that element creation fails.

If your lattices are supposed to be groups (in particular, sets), then the lattice should inherit from `Parent`, and you should implement elements as well, inheriting from `Element` (or rather `ModuleElement`, since you want to add elements). I guess it would be fine to import some implementation of integer vectors (I am sure those things exist somewhere in Sage), and assign it as a class attribute `IntegerLattice.Element`.

Next, *if* you decide to inherit from `Parent` and assign `.Element`, you should do `self._init_category_(Groups())` (or a better category, if there is any) during initialisation of your lattice. This should be enough to enable element creation and let the test suites (`TestSuite(YourLattice).run()`) pass. If it isn't---well, then we'll take care of it later.

It could make sense to have a look at `sage.combinat.free_module.CombinatorialFreeModule` and `sage.combinat.free_module.CombinatorialFreeModuleElement`. I have not much experience with it, but I know that people use it to implement all kind of things, including algebras. And it does inherit from `Parent`.

On a different note: Would it make sense to use `UniqueRepresentation` or at least `CachedRepresentation` for lattices? It seems strange to me to have a function `Lattice` that does nothing more than hand the arguments to the `IntegerLattice` constructor and return the result.

Provided that you want some kind of caching for your lattices, you could do

```python
class Lattice(CachedRepresentation, Parent):
    "This is a stub, non-integral lattices will be implemented later"
    Element = some.suitable.VectorClass
    @staticmethod
    def __classcall_private__(cls, basis, lll_reduce):
        # do some preprocessing of arguments, throw
        # an error if the basis is not integral
        return IntegerLattice(preprocessed_basis, lll_reduce)
    def __cmp__(...):
        # We don't inherit from UniqueRepresentation, hence, we admit the
        # possibility that different bases result in the same lattice.
        # Perhaps move this to IntegerLattice, unless the same algorithm
        # would work for general lattices.

class IntegerLattice(Lattice):
    ...
```

There is something called "facade". I didn't try to fully understand it, but I think the idea is: If you have the set of prime numbers, then its elements are just natural numbers. That's to say, the parent of the elements of `Primes()` is `ZZ`, not `Primes()`:

```
sage: P = Primes()
sage: p = P.an_element()
sage: p
43
sage: p.parent()
Integer Ring
```

This is done by telling that `Primes()` is a "facade set":

```
sage: P.category()
Category of facade infinite enumerated sets
```


Your situation could be similar: You have a lattice `L` in `RR^n`, and the parent of the elements of `L` wouldn't be `L` but `RR^n` (but please not `ZZ^n`, since you need the embedding!).

So, could be that using

```
sage: Category.join([FacadeSets(),CommutativeAdditiveGroups()])
Category of facade commutative additive groups
```

to initialise your lattice's category would suffice.

> I'd view the lattice somewhat analogously to an ideal in a multivariate ring, would we want our ideal elements to live anywhere but the ring?

No, see above. But for historical reasons, we have

```
sage: P.<x,y> = QQ[]
sage: I = P*[x^2+y,y^2+x]
sage: x^2 in I
False
sage: x^2+y in I
True
sage: I.category()
Category of ring ideals in Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Rational Field
```

without facade. I think today it would be implemented using facades.

> I don't want to cache my representations or make lattices unique. It is useful to have two objects representing the same lattice: one with a good basis and one with a bad basis (that's the secret and public key respectively in many crypto systems).

That's why I suggested `CachedRepresentation` rather than `UniqueRepresentation`. If you use `CachedRepresentation` than starting twice with the same basis yields identical lattices, but starting with different bases will yield non-identical lattices that may still be equal. Only `UniqueRepresentation` would imply a "comparison by identity".

Are you guys sure that special characters (such as · and δ) don't break the PDF documentation? Just asking.

What exactly does the `jacobi` method do? Sage does have a Cholesky decomposition method, but that's different (yours is rational, which is why I'm curious). Any references or explanations? (They should also go into the docstring -- also, a doctest on something other than a scalar matrix would be nice...)

Finally, I'd suggest not using such a short and generic name for a class like `Lattice` which is not likely to be implemented in foreseeable future (shouldn't the inexactness of the reals prevent such class from being implementable?).

I'd appreciate if someone else can make a short review on this part, since I do not know what should be done. (It seems that the code works, but I just don't know if this is how it is done; probably yes).

* changes in fplll.*: The changes look fine for me and the code seem to work. I have to say, I am not really familiar with the fplll interface, so maybe someone else can look at this code (but for me it is positive_review on this part).

Is this on purpose?

* fplll.pyx: OUTPUT-blocks are missing (although, most of them will state "Nothing") (The developerguide does not say that those can be skipped if nothing is returned...)

* fplll.pyx: Sometimes there are empty lines between two input-descriptions (in INPUT-block), sometimes not. This should be done in the same way everywhere.

* fplll.pyx: def BKZ: In the INPUT-block you can find the following:

```
        - ``block_size`` - 0 < block size <= nrows

        - ``no_lll`` - 
        - ``bounded_lll`` -
```

The first line looks a bit weird, since this is a mixture of math and verbated text written plain. Maybe add ``...`` or `...` there?
The last two don't have any description.

* I am not sure which of the following one should prefer for `default: 0`: `0` or ``0`` or 0?
(I have a slight preference for `0`). But this should be done in the same way everywhere.

* matrix_integer_dense.pyx:

```
        - ``prune`` - The optional parameter ``prune`` can be set to any
           positive number to invoke the Volume Heuristic from [Schnorr and
           Horner, Eurocrypt '95]. This can significantly reduce the running
           time, and hence allow much bigger block size, but the quality of the
           reduction is of course not as good in general. Higher values of
           ``prune`` mean better quality, and slower running time. When
           ``prune`` == 0, pruning is disabled. Recommended usage: for
           ``block_size`` = 30, set 10 = ``prune`` = 15.
```

The last few lines (== 0, = 30, 10 = ``prune`` = 15) look a bit weird.

* matrix_integer_dense.pyx:

```
        fpLLL SPECIFIC INPUTS:

        - ``precision`` - bit precision to use if ``fp=='rr'`` (default: 0 for automatic choice)
                                             = here ^^^^^^^^ ?
```


* in matrix_integer_dense.pyx: Sometimes there is `OUTPUT: an integer`. Shouldn't this be in separate lines?

* A couple of times the descriptions in the INPUT-block end with a full-stop; most of the times not.

* free_module_integer.py: Some missing OUTPUT-blocks

* 

```
SCORE src/sage/libs/fplll/fplll.pyx: 89.5% (17 of 19)

This essentially allows to write UTF-8 characters like δ directly, which makes the documentation easier to read.

I don't understand this point, fp='rr' is a valid parameter.

There's a couple of little things scattered throughout that I think should be fixed before this gets merged. For example, in the `LLL` definition, you have non-ascii characters where I think you should just use the latex equivalents. The reference should be:

```
.. [Ref] blah on first line that needs continuing on
   the second line
```

(you have one space less and would be slightly surprised the doc builds and has well-formatted output). You could likely benefit from raw string formatting:

```
def foo():
    r"""
    The r in front makes this a "raw" string, so the backslash isn't an
    escape character. So you can do things like this: `\ZZ` and `\alpha`.
    """
    pass
```

The documentation builds and - as far as I can tell - has well formated output. If you'd prefer it to be aligned for consistency, I'm not objecting.

> You could likely benefit from raw string formatting:

I know this exists, but I find ``\\ZZ`` more straight-forward. I don't think it needs to be changed, but if you prefer it differently, feel free to go ahead.

Python 3 compliance would be good :)

Thanks.

Replying to [comment:89 malb]:

yes

> Maybe the underlying software uses single precision floats and this is meant to approximate that?

No, since ages (libppl interface was added in 2011 or 2012, I gather - although it could have taken more time for it to become default) `Polyhedron()` uses ppl as backend, if given rational data, so it's exact.
I thought that line does some clever rounding to speed things up, but still I can't imagine a maths statement which could make it rigorous.

Should we just drop the rounding?

It's actually quite strange - you first convert your data to `float()`, and then build a polyhedron with coodinates obtained by rounding these floats and converting them into QQ.

It's a miracle to me that it (mostly) works.
