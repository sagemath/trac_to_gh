# Issue 22908: Interval and ball field elements conversion to Python float/complex

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2017-06-06 06:55:20

Each of `float(RIF(1))`,`float(RBF(1))`,`float(CBF(1))` fails with

```
TypeError: float() argument must be a string or a number
```

and `float(CIF(1))` fails with

```
TypeError: can't convert complex interval to float
```

i.e. the `_float_()` member exists but is not implemented.

These should all be there because we can naturally convert to `RR`, which has coercions to `RDF` and floats.
