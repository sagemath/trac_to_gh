Ok, let me understand the code. There is a recording of exceptions that are very convenient for debugging. The problem is that it produces an important performance penalty. This is solved with record_exceptions() that controls the attribute _record_exceptions which is the flag that controls.

Just one thing. Each time that record_exceptions is called, the exception stack cached is cleared so:


```
sage: cm = sage.structure.element.get_coercion_model()
sage: cm.record_exceptions()
sage: cm._test_exception_stack()
sage: cm.record_exceptions()
sage: cm.exception_stack()
[]            
```


Is this the intended behavior? It is trivially seen from the code but I think it should be documented.
