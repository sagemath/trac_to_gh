# Issue 22290: attach() does not access interpreter globals

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2017-03-06 13:06:55

Unlike `load()`, the command `attach()` does not give access to globals. Create a file called `test.sage` containing

```
a = 1
```

and attach it in a *non-IPython* session:

```
$ ./sage --python
Python 2.7.13 (default, Mar  2 2017, 10:40:24) 
[GCC 4.9.4] on linux2

>>> from sage.all import *
>>> attach("/tmp/test.sage")
