From #19083, comment 66, 33:
> I think that there is shared code between `__invert__`, `__log__`, `__exp__` and powers with rational exponents. In all those cases, it is important to split into main term and renormalized remainder. The main term is then processed according to the respective method, the remainder is inserted into a converging taylor series with certain coefficients (this could be handeled by one method getting the sequence of taylor coefficients as an argument).

1. What I had in mind was more commonality between the three methods: Most of the methods deal with writing `self = max_elem * (1 + geom)`. This part could be done by a common routine. (log and inversion a slightly more comfortable with `1 - geom`, but I'd prefer to read standard taylor coefficients.
2. `_taylor_`:
  - I am not convinced of the name of the method. `_power_series_` ?
  - The role of `precision` is not explained.
  - There should be a doctest where a fixed point is reached before reaching `precision`
3. logarithm: I think that it would be more readable to start with 0 and let the coefficients start at `k=1`.

done.

I used `-x` and everything is fine.

> 2. `_taylor_`:
>   - I am not convinced of the name of the method. `_power_series_` ?

done.

still to do.

still to do.

> 3. logarithm: I think that it would be more readable to start with 0 and let the coefficients start at `k=1`.

I can live with the previous implementation for efficiency reasons.

From my side, that's it. Please (cross-)review my changes.

Cross-reviewed and fine from my side, but I've put a punch of small commits on top. Please cross-review them.

Dima, thanks for setting this to positive on my behalf.

Patchbot "findstat" shows errors which should be in no way related to this ticket.
