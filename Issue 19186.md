done.

I used `-x` and everything is fine.

> 2. `_taylor_`:
>    - I am not convinced of the name of the method. `_power_series_` ?


done.

still to do.

>   - There should be a doctest where a fixed point is reached before reaching `precision`


still to do.

> 3. logarithm: I think that it would be more readable to start with 0 and let the coefficients start at `k=1`.


I can live with the previous implementation for efficiency reasons.
