The main install.log file is huge, and most of its contents are reproduced, more helpfully, in the individual log files in spkg/log/. The attached patch removes most of its contents.

I modified the mpir package so it would fail, and then built Sage with this patch. The install.log file looked like this:

```
Installing GCC because your 'gcc' is not so recent.
Installing GCC because a Fortran compiler is missing.
*** ALL ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES BEFORE BUILD: ***

To me it would also make more sense to reduce the (default) *screen* output; the size of `install.log` doesn't bother me much, although it doesn't hurt if that gets "more readable" as well.

Here's a different patch. With it, install.log looks like it does now (large, with the output from the different processes all mixed together). The screen looks like this:

```
$ make
cd spkg && env SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD='' ./install all 2>&1

also logs its output into an individual log file, as indicated.

Since we're going to *generate* the effective `Makefile` anyway, I wouldn't patch `deps`, but only put dependencies (as its name suggests) into it, and flexibly generate the build *rules* on-the-fly, depending on what output / verbosity level is currently requested.

I.e., `deps` would just contain lines like

```make
$(INST)/$(ATLAS): $(BASE) $(INST)/$(LAPACK) $(INST)/$(PYTHON) $(INST)/$(PATCH)
 
$(INST)/$(BOEHM_GC): $(BASE) $(INST)/$(PATCH)

$(INST)/$(BOOST_CROPPED): $(BASE) $(INST)/$(PATCH)
 
$(INST)/$(CLIQUER): $(BASE) $(INST)/$(PATCH)
 
$(INST)/$(TERMCAP): $(BASE) $(INST)/$(PATCH)
```

or, preferably:

```make
$(ATLAS): $(BASE) $(LAPACK) $(PYTHON) $(PATCH)
 
$(BOEHM_GC): $(BASE) $(PATCH)

$(BOOST_CROPPED): $(BASE) $(PATCH)
 
$(CLIQUER): $(BASE) $(PATCH)
 
$(TERMCAP): $(BASE) $(PATCH)
```

Or, for the example given:

```make
$(ATLAS) $(BOEHM_GC) $(BOOST_CROPPED) $(CLIQUER) $(TERMCAP): $(BASE) $(PATCH)

$(ATLAS): $(LAPACK) $(PYTHON)
```


(In general, one could write *a single* `make` rule for building / installing all spkgs, probably with some changes to the directory structure though.)

Well, as mentioned, the amount of output (especially to the screen) should be *configurable*, which is IMHO feasable.

The *average user<sup>TM</sup>* will hardly be interested in what we produce now (while some kind of `install.log` could still be complete, also configurably);  buildbots should certainly create "full" logs.

If a user disables all full logs but afterwards reports some hardly reproducable error (presumably due to some race condition), he and we will have to live with that;  that's not much different to the frequent case where the logs (or further details regarding the build conditions) *somehow* got lost...

Sure, it's feasible but why would you ever be bothered by how much stuff is written to the screen?

> The *average user<sup>TM</sup>* will hardly be interested in what we produce now
Which also implies that the average user doesn't care. Hence, the average user would be happy with the status quo.

Third, I can think of one problem this could solve: you try to build Sage in parallel, and it fails to build. Which package failed? You can figure that out, but perhaps it should be more obvious.

After reading through the comments on this ticket again, I am still convinced it should be closed as "wontfix". The few megabytes that this file takes is not a major problem and, as some comments note, the full log is still useful for debugging race conditions during a parallel build.

This is now clearer since #14263: a list of failed packages (with log files) is output after the build fails.
