# Issue 15311: Do not always rebuild sage/csage

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2013-12-19 13:22:33

CC:  ohanar

There is no reason to rebuild the `sage` and `csage` targets all the time in `build/Makefile`, since those are included in `./sage -b` anyway.

Those targets still need to be in the `Makefile` for the initial installation, but then we can use the standard `$(INST)/sage` mechanism for that.

Looks fine, and does what it's supposed to.

This apparently fails on older shells, e.g. redhawk (full log: http://build.sagemath.org/sage/builders/%20%20fast%20UW%20redhawk%20%28Ubuntu%2010.04%20x86_64%29%20full/builds/8/steps/compile_1/logs/stdio). Here I restarted the failed build. There was no csage log created, for the record:

```
buildbot`@`redhawk build$ make
cd build && \
	"../build/pipestatus" \
		"env SAGE_PARALLEL_SPKG_BUILD='' ./install all 2>&1" \
		"tee -a ../logs/install.log"

Error building Sage.

The following package(s) may have failed to build:

The build directory may contain configuration files and other potentially
helpful information. WARNING: if you now run 'make' again, the build
directory will, by default, be deleted. Set the environment variable
SAGE_KEEP_BUILT_SPKGS to 'yes' to prevent this.

make: *** [build] Error 1
buildbot`@`redhawk build$ ./sage -sh

Starting subshell with Sage environment variables set.  Don't forget
to exit when you are done.  Beware:
 * Do not do anything with other copies of Sage on your system.
 * Do not use this for installing Sage packages using "sage -i" or for
   running "make" at Sage's root directory.  These should be done
   outside the Sage shell.

Bypassing shell configuration files...

Can I somehow access the failed build?

Did any other ticket modify `sage-env`?

Not an old shell at all:

The problem seems to be that `make` uses `/bin/sh` as shell which is a very simple-minded shell on `redhawk`.
