This is a duplicate of #7747 (or rather, #7747 is a duplicate of this one).  The patch in #7747 does a little more; can we merge that one instead?

AFAICT by looking at comment:3, this patch was merged. The patch on #7747 should be rebased in this case.

I don't see why you couldn't just merge the patch at #7747 on top of this one, and ignored the failed hunks.
