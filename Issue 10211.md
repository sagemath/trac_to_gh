This sounds good; I always am annoyed by calculators which do the latter.  I assume this proposal would still return the parameter values as well, correct?

Or at least that the new function would make it _really_ clear in documentation how to get them...

The point of this ticket is having a function that returns an expression and another that returns parameters. So yes, I'll try to make the difference clear in the documentation.
