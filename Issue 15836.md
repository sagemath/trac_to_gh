Keywords: python3

In Py2 `map()` returns a list, while in Py3 `map()` returns an iterator (as `itertools.imap()` does in Py2).

The tool 2to3 wraps `map()` usages with a call to `list()`.


An alternative approach is to add `from future_builtins import map` and to check the code.

There are 171 effected modules. 

This ticket is tracked as a dependency of meta-ticket ticket:16052.

The code would now certainly benefit from changing expressions like `list(map(...))` into a list comprehension. 

This is more pythonic, more readable (especially in the case `list(map(lambda ...))` ) and it avoids redundant list creation in Python 2. But it's a lot of stuff to check and change ...

OK, but as I expected there are some questionable things here.

```
- r = sum ( map( lambda x: x[2], cycle ) )
+ r = sum ( [x[2] for x in cycle] )
```

Wouldn't keeping the old line be better? Summing an iterator should be faster than summing a list which has been constructed merely to be summed.

You are right.

In this case we should write

```
r = sum ( (x[2] for x in cycle) )
```


Feel free to fix it (and others), currently I have no time to check the necessity of `list()` wrapping.

```
- return "".join(map(lambda x: self._character_to_code[x], string))
+ return "".join([self._character_to_code[x] for x in string])
```

Wondering if this is a good step forward, given that you can join an iterator to a string:

```
>>> map(lambda x: x+x, ['a','b','c'])
<map object at 0x7fd747ddee10>
>>> "blah".join(map(lambda x: x+x, ['a','b','c']))
'aablahbbblahcc'
```

(Python 3).

--------


```
- map(
- lambda x: chr(ord(x) + 49),
- list(str(num[0]))),
+ [chr(ord(x) + 49) for x in list(str(num[0]))],
```

Can't we get rid of the `list`?

--------


```
- a,b,c,d,e,f = map(G,R)
+ a,b,c,d,e,f = list(map(G,R))
```

This seems to not be necessary:

```
>>> a,b,c = iter([1,2,3])
>>> a
1
>>> b
2
>>> c
3
```


--------

This is unnecessary:

```
- if all(map(lambda s: s.is_final, state.label())):
+ if all([s.is_final for s in state.label()]):
```

If anything then `all` definitely works on iterators.

Here is the thing that worries me the most: There are tools for automatic translation of python2 into 3. I am not sure if we should, or are going to, release them on the Sage library; but if we are, I would rather not do any manual work unless we can make sure that it will not interfere with the automated changes.

These tools don't work well in all cases and usually one can disable special fixes. So manual work won't interfere with automated changes.

The target of these changes is to simplify the switch to python 3 without complicating the situation. :)

I have no problems with `cmdline.py`. Results keep the same with and without merging `origin/develop` into `16073`.

Strange! And Volker just released sage-6.5.beta0 and auto-merge failed again ... :-(

By the way, back in June I was working to replace `map` with list comprehension or generator expressions (mostly). It was not quite complete when I took some time off.

I want to give that approach a fresh start on sage-6.5.beta0. I will describe the reasoning tomorrow (or so ...).

I uploaded a new branch `u/wluebbe/ticket/16073-2`.

My goal is to replace all `map` calls with list comprehension or generator expressions. Currently there are still about 40 `list(map(...` in the code (somehow my regexp did not find them :-/ ) and a number of `map`s in the doctests. So there is still some work to do.

The drawback of wrapping `map` with `list` is that in Python2 this is redundant.
If a context accepts iterators then in Python2 `map` cannot exploit this (as it returns a list). Remapping `map` in Python2 on its iterator version `itertools.imap` requires extra code.

The current branch does change list comprehensions to generator expressions in all possible cases. I would rather leave this refactoring to a new ticket since there are lots of applicable cases separate from 16073.

No, unfortunately there are still a significant number of `map`s in the code base.

There are still a lot of `map()` call in the code. 

But //not all// occurrences must be  removed: there are a number of places where a Py3 `map()`-iterator leads to the same result as the Py2 `map()`.

Here is a long (but incomplete) list:

```
all(here_is_an_iterable_allowed)
any(here_is_an_iterable_allowed)
bytearray(here_is_an_iterable_allowed)
dict(here_is_an_iterable_of_key_value_pairs_allowed)
filter(function, here_is_an_iterable_allowed)
frozenset(here_is_an_iterable_allowed)
list(here_is_an_iterable_allowed)
map(function, here_is_an_iterable_allowed)
max(here_is_an_iterable_allowed)
min(here_is_an_iterable_allowed)
reduce(function, here_is_an_iterable_allowed)
set(here_is_an_iterable_allowed)
sorted(here_is_an_iterable_allowed)
sum(here_is_an_iterable_allowed)
tuple(here_is_an_iterable_allowed)
zip(here_is_an_iterable_allowed)

''.join(here_is_an_iterable_allowed)
a,b,c* = here_is_an_iterable_allowed
x[i:j] = here_is_an_iterable_allowed
a_dict.update(here_is_an_iterable_of_key_value_pairs_allowed)
file.writelines(here_is_an_iterable_allowed)
math.fsum(here_is_an_iterable_allowed)

and MANY functions in module itertools.

for i in here_is_an_iterable_allowed:
    pass
[2*x for x in here_is_an_iterable_allowed]
(2*x for x in here_is_an_iterable_allowed)
```


But if the use of `map` includes a `lambda` then replacing it with a list comprehension improves the readability!
