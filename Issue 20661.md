Keywords: linear code, syndrome

There is a bug in how the decoder type is set for the syndrome decoder. Consider


```
sage: C = codes.HammingCode(GF(5), 3)
sage: D = C.decoder("Syndrome")
sage: C.minimum_distance()
3
sage: D.maximum_error_weight()
1
sage: D.decoder_type()
{'complete', 'hard-decision', 'might-error', 'unique'}
```


The last line should not have had "might-error" but instead should have had "always-succeed" and "minimum-distance".

There was actually 2 bugs: the decoding_radius tested for this decision was not updated with the value found during the construction of the lookup table. Then some set.add needed to be changed.

I also added the ticket's code as a doctest.

Attached branch should fix the pb. Open for review.
