Sometimes, patchbot reports a `sig_error() without sig_on()` when tests are run on `sage/geometry/cone.py`.

Now this out-of-memory situation is not gracefully handled. I could change the code to `raise MemoryError` instead of crashing, but that won't solve the underlying issue that it is running out of memory.

This test shouldn't generate a cone with an unbounded number of rays. The `random_cone` method is capable of "resetting" itself, and this test is meant to check that "reset" behavior.

If I want a random cone in three dimensions with 7 extreme rays, I will start generating random rays and adding them to my cone, starting with the trivial cone. But eventually, what will likely happen is that I'll wind up with all of `R^3`, which needs only six generators. At that point, the approach is doomed: if I generate more rays and add them to `R^3`, I still get `R^3`. So what can be done? Throw it out and start over!

There do exist cones in `R^3` with 7 extreme rays, it just takes some luck to find them using the approach that `random_cone` takes. So this test ensures that we will throw out a "doomed" cone and start over when we arrive at one.

The test should succeed as soon as it gets 7 rays, and not an unbounded number. Instead, I think there's probably a little bit of memory that isn't getting freed when we throw out the old, doomed random cone and start over.

Do I need some trick like `K = None` when we're going to loop?

```

To be specific, we loop until the random cone (in progress) K "is valid",


```
if is_valid(K):
    # Loop if we don't have a valid cone.
    return K
```


But that will be true as soon as this is true,


```
all([
    K.nrays() >= min_rays,
    K.nrays() <= max_rays or max_rays is None,
    K.is_solid() == solid or solid is None,
    K.is_strictly_convex() == strictly_convex or strictly_convex is None
])
```


And in this case, since everything but `min_rays` is `None`, all we need is `K.nrays() >= min_rays`. Since we add them one-at-a-time, I would hope that we always get 7.

Aaaaaaaaand nevermind. The default for `max_rays` is `None`, which is a priori fine. The random cone generation works like I said it does above: if you try to add a million rays, you'll usually get to the sixth or seventh before you've got all of `R^3`, and then the whole thing will restart.

But there's this little snippet, which tries to construct a decent number of starting rays before we begin to generate and add them one at a time:


```
r = random_min_max(min_rays, max_rays)
rays = [L.random_element() for i in range(r)]
```


I would bet that the problem is right there, where we can generate a huge list of random rays, even if rays 7 through N will get thrown out as being redundant.

I think that's a bug in my implementation.

Proposed fix: replace,


```
rays = [L.random_element() for i in range(r)]
```


with


```
rays = [L.random_element() for i in range(min_rays)]

That will be a tiny bit slower in some cases, but far more sane when `max_rays` is `None`.

It will take me a day or two to build sage (it's been a while), so you have plenty of time to let me know if that does the trick =)

I think we should keep your original fix, too, and specify `max_rays=9` in the test. The code for `max_rays=None` should not go insane, obviously, but the test case shouldn't loop more than is necessary either.

I also added an "if" statement to retain the original behavior when `max_rays` is not `None`. There's a trade-off here; namely that the user can still cause himself pain and suffering by specifying e.g. `max_rays=1000000` in a three-dimensional space (basically, the problem in this ticket). On the other hand, we would like to avoid generating rays and checking the cone's validity one ray at a time if `min_rays=1` and `max_rays=1000` in a thousand-dimensional space. If we pick `r=500` in that case, we're much better off generating 500 random rays at the start.

In any case, this shouldn't cause problems for the test suite any longer.

I didn't notice the rest of your comment changes before working on this, but it looks like they all followed from the `r` -> `min_rays` change, which is now only conditional, so please let me know if there's any other comment fix I should pull.

Why? You convinced me that it was not the right fix and I agreed with you :-)

Note that without `max_rays=9` the number of rays won't get very large anyway since the `while` loop which adds rays will early abort once we reach the full space. In a 3-dimensional space it would be quite unlikely already to have even 10 rays not spanning the whole space. So I do think that my original fix was sufficient. And also a better test because there is no need to artificially limit the number of rays.

It's just faster for the poor folks who run ptestlong. I saw about a 5 second average improvement with `max_rays=9`, mentioned at the bottom of the commit message.

The problem with leaving it unbounded is that you wind up looping...

1. A random, large upper bound is chosen.
2. We choose `r` between 7 and that large number; also generally large.
3. We try to attain `r` rays, by adding one at a time...
4. We wind up with the full space, and GOTO 1.

With `max_rays=9`, the picture is only a little different:

1. We choose `r` between 7 and 9 (much more reasonable!)
2. We try to attain `r` rays, by adding one at a time...
3. We usually wind up with the full space and GOTO 1, but, more often than before we can achieve 7, 8, or 9 rays.

In the second scenario, you don't have to get lucky and choose a small random number.

Trying to mention a commit hash during `rebase -i` is not working out for me...

I'll put the original test case back if you like, but I think it's making an already-long test even longer for not much benefit.
