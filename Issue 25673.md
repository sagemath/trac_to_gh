The product of chains is a sufficiently common poset to warrant inclusion in the catalog of posets

Trivial little tweaks for the docs:

```
        - ``chain_lengths`` -- a list of nonnegative integers; number of
          elements in each chain

        - ``facade`` -- boolean; whether to make the returned poset a
```

It seems redundant to create a `Poset` just to create a `FiniteLatticePoset`:

```
        if len(chain_lengths) == 0:
            return FiniteLatticePoset(Poset(facade=facade))
```

Also, it is faster to do `if not chain_lengths:`.

The compare function doesn't need to check to see if they're not equal, compare(a,b) just needs to return True if a<=b , not just a<b .
