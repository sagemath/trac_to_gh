# Issue 7432: Missing ` ` in hecke/module.py

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/7432

Assignee: hivert

While browsing the doc I found some missing "` `" in `modular/hecke/module.py`. I fixed them.

Note: there should be a systematic re-reading for those. But I don't have the time for this.

Cheers,

Florent
