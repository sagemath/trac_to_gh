CC:  @slel

This patch will make plain `graphs(n)` to use nauty. Otherwise, for example if user uses `size` option or similar, old behavior is continued.

Not committing to a full review of this ticket, but just pointing out
a typo: hamiltionian -> hamiltonian.

Also not sure about the change to the pre-existing doctest


```
Use ``graphs(n)`` to iterate through all non-isomorphic graphs of given size::

    sage: for g in graphs(4):
    ....:     print(g.spectrum())
```


which checked that we get 11 graphs on 4 vertices, and that they are
pairwise non-isomorphic (since their spectra are). The proposed
replacement doctest does not illustrate that.

It's too long for that, a user won't easily see if there are duplicates or not. But better example would be nice.
