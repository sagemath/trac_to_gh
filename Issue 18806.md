Most of what `build/make/install` does really belongs in `configure`, in particular creating `build/make/Makefile`. This ticket moves that part to `configure` and adjusts the top-level build system to make this work.

There are two advantages:
1. Running `make` is a lot simpler and hence faster.
2. It allows using `./configure` to configure the list of packages (note that this ticket does not implement that, it just makes it possible to implement that in future tickets)

There is an important change for developers: any change to the list or versions of packages will require a run of `./configure` to take effect. Note that `./configure` will be re-run automatically if `./configure` itself changes, which happens with every Sage version. So there is no need to manually rerun `./configure` if you're just switching between versions.

I don't care about having a "perfect" history (and normally review the final diff from `develop`).

Overall it looks good from my testing. However, I'm not quite sure about this

> There is an important change for developers: any change to the list or versions of packages will require a run of `./configure` to take effect.


To make sure I understand correctly, does this mean that anytime we want to do a version bump of packages (or add one), we have to manually run `$SAGE_ROOT/configure`? If so, then I think we should put something about this in the spkg development guide. Also, is `configure` updated on beta version changes or just on stable releases?

Also is there a reason why you moved the "if root" test lower in the file? I would think we'd want such build failures to happen as early on as possible.

OK, I see your point. I'd rather make that a separate ticket, there might be other changes to the spkg development guide I want to make.

There is no real particular reason, it felt more logical to put it where it currently is.

Fair enough, but let's make that spkg dev guide update ticket a blocker.

Thanks for the explanation.

I feel that some of those configuration steps could take some time, just to have it fail for an unrelated reason. However I don't really care about this; it was more out of curiosity.
