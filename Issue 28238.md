A nitpick, but probably better to have code formatting for things

```diff
-self.nrows() \* self.ncols()
+``self.nrows() * self.ncols()``
```


```diff
-``self`` \* ``right``
+``self * right``
```


```diff
-A*v
+``A * v``
```

If you disagree with any of them, just ignore. Once you have changed what you want, positive review.

has this broken sparse matrices over finite fields?

```
B=matrix(GF(3), 2,2,[1,0,1,0], sparse=True)
v=vector(GF(3), [1,1])
B.solve_right(v)
```

giving

```
TypeError: Cannot convert sage.matrix.matrix_modn_sparse.Matrix_modn_sparse to sage.matrix.matrix_integer_sparse.Matrix_integer_sparse

```
