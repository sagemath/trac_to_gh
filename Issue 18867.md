# Issue 18867: Parse sage-spkg options in sage-spkg

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19104

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2015-08-27 17:39:19

Instead of parsing the options to `sage -i` both in `src/bin/sage` and in `sage-spkg`, parse them just in `sage-spkg` (without requiring a specific order).

Tries to compile patch and then fails with weird errors, something wrong with environment variables I guess. 

PS: I can compile just patch (`sage -f patch`) just fine, for the record

Did you test with just this ticket, or with #19101 and other tickets?

Got it, just forgot support for `SAGE_INSTALL_FETCH_ONLY`.
