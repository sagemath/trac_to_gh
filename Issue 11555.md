I'm not quite sure how this happened, but apparently in newer Cygwins patch won't accept certain things.

FLINT now doesn't actually work on one of my Cygwins, even after #11547, because of an extra line that crept into one of the patches.

Note the newline at the end; removing this solves the problem.  I guess this didn't cause trouble on other systems, since these patches are applied universally.  I can't even figure out where this change happened.

patches/mpn_extras.h.patch
is in DOS mode. As well, some files in src/are in DOS mode, too.
Please convert all the files in the spkg into Unix mode.
This is in fact just on-liner (assuming dos2unix installed):

```
flint-1.5.0.p9$ find . -type f -exec dos2unix '{}' \;
```

New package, with this done, at http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/dima/packages/flint-1.5.0.p9.spkg
I checked in on Linux and MacOSX only - please check on Cygwin.
