The sigma invariants are the elementary symmetric functions evaluated at the multipliers. Currently they are computed over QQbar which can be very time consuming. They can be computed via resultants which is much faster and includes maps defined over polynomial rings.

well, it seems both definitions are used in the world.

- define the sigma using every period n point (McMullen, Silverman). Really they define it from the fixed points of the nth iterate.

- define the sigma via cycles (Milnor)

In both cases they define invariants of the moduli space, so it's not that one is right or wrong, they are just different.  I'm tempted to introduce a 'type' parameter that takes values 'cycles' or 'points' to both this function and multiplier_spectrum.


What do you think?

Ok I looked this over and did some testing. The new method of computing the sigma invariants appears to be correct (and much nicer than the previous implementation!), and everything seems to be working properly. I only found a few really minor issues:

In sigma_invariants:
- line 3725, multiplicity is spelled incorrectly (also occurs line 3565 in multiplier_spectra)
- line 3750, add another space around the hyphen (also occurs line 3579)
- line 3780, there is an extra newline
- need an input check in place to make sure the base ring is (or has its coefficients in) a number field
- perhaps put the "type" input check on line 3897 that can raise a value error with the other input checks at the beginning (same comment for multiplier_spectra)
- it also might be good to add an example with formal=True illustrating the different options type='cycle', 'point'

Those changes look good. However I don't think the part of sigma_invariants that looks for a conjugation to avoid the point at infinity makes sense in positive characteristic:


```
sage: P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(GF(3),1)
sage: H = End(P)
sage: f = H([x^2 - 2*y^2, y^2])
sage: f.sigma_invariants(1)
Traceback (click to the left of this block for traceback)
...
ZeroDivisionError: Inverse does not exist.
```


When working over a finite field, if it is possible to construct a morphism P1-->P1 that has every point of P1 as a n-periodic point that seems like it could also be a problem.

ok. Here's another try at this. I'm no longer trying to move infinity out of the fixed points and instead am dealing with the multiplier at infinity and its multiplicities as a special case.

Interestingly, it looks like this exposed an issue with one of the earlier examples and also an issue when there are cycles of different periods with the same multiplier.

The new type='cycle' functionality looks good to me. While looking over the code I noticed just a few more superficial issues:

- line 3754: add period after "Default: False"
- line 3962: there's an extra newline
- the expressions of the form

```
e_inf = 1
while (y**e_inf).divides(fix_poly):
    e_inf += 1
e_inf -= 1
```

   could be shortened slightly to

```
e_inf = 0
while (y**(e_inf + 1)).divides(fix_poly):
    e_inf += 1
```

- change the code starting on line 3956 from

```
res = fix_poly.resultant(mult_poly, S.gen(0)).univariate_polynomial()
#take infinty into consideration
if inf_per.divides(n):
   res = res*((S.gen(1) - self.multiplier(inf, n)[0,0])**e_inf)
   res = res.univariate_polynomial()
```

   to

```
res = fix_poly.resultant(mult_poly, S.gen(0))
#take infinty into consideration
if inf_per.divides(n):
   res = res*((S.gen(1) - self.multiplier(inf, n)[0,0])**e_inf)
res = res.univariate_polynomial()
```

   otherwise there is a weird multiplication issue:

```
sage: P.<x,y> = ProjectiveSpace(QQ,1)
sage: H = End(P)
sage: f = H([x^2 + x*y + y^2, y^2 + x*y])
sage: f.sigma_invariants(1)
```

   The same issue occurs in the formal=True block version of this code starting at 3925. It looks like this actually always occurs with multiplication with elements of the original polynomial ring after calling .univariate_polynomial() for a constant polynomial:

```
sage: R.<s,t> = PolynomialRing(QQ, 2)
sage: f = R(1)
sage: f.univariate_polynomial()*t
```

   fails, but

```
sage: R.<s,t> = PolynomialRing(QQ, 2)
sage: f = s
sage: f.univariate_polynomial()*t
```

   is fine.
- the lines of the form `res = res*((S.gen(1) - self.multiplier(inf, n)[0,0])**e_inf)`
   could be rewritten `res *= (S.gen(1) - self.multiplier(inf, n)[0,0])**e_inf`
