A comment should always start with a space after '#'. As well, `self[1:len(self)-1]` should be transformed in `self[1:len(self) - 1]`. For more info on Python and Sage conventions, see http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/coding_basics.html#python-code-style 

I'm also wondering about the first condition: When the length of a word can be strictly shorter than 0?

Also, a single letter is a Christoffel word, according to the reference you give (Berstel et al.) Right now, it returns false because it is a palindrome. You should add a test for it.
