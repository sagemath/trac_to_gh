From `./sage -t --long src/sage/matrix/ src/sage/combinat/posets/` (yep, last one was an error) I got


```
sage -t --long --warn-long 42.1 src/sage/matrix/matrix_integer_dense.pyx
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/matrix/matrix_integer_dense.pyx", line 4113, in sage.matrix.matrix_integer_dense.Matrix_integer_dense._solve_iml
Failed example:
    t < 10 or t
Expected:
    True
Got:
    28.771737098693848
```


but from `./sage -t --long src/sage/matrix/matrix_integer_dense.pyx` I got "All tests passed!". Please check this. I do not understand where this came from.

I got it again, with `17.307713985443115` as a value. However, now I can not reproduce it third time. I suppose it is heisenbug not related to your code, or then my hardware is faulty.

Hence positive review for this one.
