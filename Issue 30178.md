# Issue 30178: Remove pyflakes?

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30415

With #30361 and #30404 pyright is added as a static type checker. Besides type checking, it also includes almost all checks that are performed by pyflakes. 

As far as I can see, the differences are as follows:
- Pyright excels at type checking
- Pyflakes has no support for type checking, and indeed is not even able to handle basic typing syntax (this would need among others https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes/pull/530, which seems to be stale) 
- Pyflakes checks for basic validity of the arguments to "format" and "print", this is not supported by pyright 

So it depends on how important the print and format validation are. Maybe they are also covered by lgtm?

Resources:
- List of checks of pyright: https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/blob/master/docs/configuration.md#type-check-diagnostics-settings
- List of checks of pyflakes: https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/error-codes.html


Depending on the outcome, the stub documentation of pyflakes added in #30361 needs be extended or removed.

`flake8` (https://pypi.org/project/flake8/) also seems to have some valuable plugins:
 - https://pypi.org/project/flake8-rst-docstrings/
 - https://pypi.org/project/flake8-docstrings/  (uses https://github.com/pycqa/pydocstyle)

Setting new milestone based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.
