This ticket, inspired by a proposal by embray in #24586, removes the misuse of "package type" for the undocumented "script package" category (introduced in #19427). Likewise, it removes the same misuse of "package type" for the undocumented (as noted in #21033) "pip package" category (introduced in #19187).

With this ticket, `type` has to be one of `base` / `standard` / `optional` / `experimental`.

All `type=pip` packages are changed to `optional`.

All `type=script` packages are changed to `optional`; with the exception of `sage_conf`, which is a dependency of `sagelib` and is changed to `standard`.

Orthogonal to `type` is the new notion of a package "source", which is defined as follows:
- `normal` packages have a `checksum.ini` file
- `pip` packages have a `requirements.txt` file instead (which is used for `pip install`). (This allows us to change the `pyopenssl` package from `script` to `pip`.)
- `script` packages have neither of the two

The ticket also makes `script` packages more similar to `normal` packages: They can now optionally have a `package-version.txt` file; and their installation status is recorded.

Finally, this ticket adds documentation to the developer manual.

we had an argument about it, and that change should have been done when the actual conversion of most of sage-install scripts into templates happened, a couple of years back. So this change merely corrects an old fault of the naming scheme.

```

The doctest was actually "broken" by #29038 in the situation when the `sage_conf` package that it added is installed.
See ticket description of #29038 -- in particular, it provides `SAGE_ROOT` in the situation that Python imports `sage.all` outside of a sage-env.
That doctest was testing that `SAGE_ROOT` is not provided in that situation -- when it should simply have tested that the `sage.all` module works.

The present ticket makes sure that `sage_conf` is always installed (fixes #29365, for example), and so you now saw the doctest failure.

This is an incidental bugfix for something that was broken by some earlier ticket. Seems nobody has tried `sage -i texlive` in a while.
