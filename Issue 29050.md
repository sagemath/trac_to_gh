CC:  @embray @dimpase @jhpalmieri tmonteil @vbraun

This would enable having "optional" "script" packages. (Needed for #27952 - libnauty)

`type` would only be used for "standard/optional/experimental".

- regular packages have a `checksum.ini`
- pip packages have `requirements.txt` instead
- script packages have neither of the two

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29287

we had an argument about it, and that change should have been done when the actual conversion of most of sage-install scripts into templates happened, a couple of years back. So this change merely corrects an old fault of the naming scheme.

Can you explain the doctest failure? For some reason, there was no output before, but now there is output?

The doctest was actually "broken" by #29038 in the situation when the `sage_conf` package that it added is installed.
See ticket description of #29038 -- in particular, it provides `SAGE_ROOT` in the situation that Python imports `sage.all` outside of a sage-env.
That doctest was testing that `SAGE_ROOT` is not provided in that situation -- when it should simply have tested that the `sage.all` module works.

The present ticket makes sure that `sage_conf` is always installed (fixes #29365, for example), and so you now saw the doctest failure.

This is an incidental bugfix for something that was broken by some earlier ticket. Seems nobody has tried `sage -i texlive` in a while.
