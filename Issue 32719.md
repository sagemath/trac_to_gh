So, I understand that by removing ffmpeg and imagemagick from `_recommended/distros/*.txt` files, they will not be suggested to be installed when they are already installed anymore.

But, in the case that ffmpeg and imagemagick are not installed, let's say, will the configure script say that these are recommended packages somehow? I don't see how this will happen with the commits I have done in the ticket so far.

(also, let's do `pdftocairo` in another ticket, maybe in #20343 if I use it instead of `pdf2svg`)

Anyway, needs review!
