# Issue 21552: Maxima can solve this bvp why not sage?

According to [this sage-devel post](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/-IESBlP7v0s)

```
y(x) = function('y')(x); y
eq = x^2*diff(y,x,2)-x*diff(y,x,1)+y==0; eq
h = desolve(eq, dvar=y, ivar=x,ics=[1,1,e,2*e]); h
```

gives an error but Maxima can nonetheless solve it.

strangely enough, it works if you use `e^1`, as in:


```
sage: y(x) = function('y')(x); y
x |--> y(x)
sage: eq = x^2*diff(y,x,2)-x*diff(y,x,1)+y==0; eq
x |--> x^2*diff(y(x), x, x) - x*diff(y(x), x) + y(x) == 0
sage: h = desolve(eq, dvar=y, ivar=x,ics=[1,1,e^1,2*e^1]); h
x*(log(x) + 1)
```

May be related to #24102 (see [this comment](https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24102#comment:1)...)
