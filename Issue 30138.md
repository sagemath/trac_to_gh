CC:  slelievre dimpase

Keywords: compile flags

We gather and clean up compiler flags. Also we

    add --enable-fat-binary to configure (as an alternative to setting SAGE_FAT_BINARY)
    add --enable_debug={no|symbols|yes} as alternative to setting SAGE_DEBUG 

    compile with -Og -g if SAGE_DEBUG=yes
    compile with -O2 if SAGE_DEBUG=no (some packages with O3 instead)
    compile with -O2 -g otherwise (some packages with O3 instead) 

During the build of sage there are now flags that can be exported in spkg_install.in with one line, instead of checking SAGE_DEBUG etc. for each individual package, e.g. by

    export CFLAGS=$CFLAGS (redundant, use flags as above)
    export CFLAGS=$CFLAGS_O3 (O3 instead of O2, but only if not in debug mode)
    export CFLAGS=$ORIGINAL_CFLAGS (use $CFLAGS as set before configure) 

Likewise we do with CXXFLAGS, FCFLAGS, F77FLAGS.

We try to respect the users choice and do not overwrite the flags if already set by the user, but only add compile flags if necessary for packages to work.

Inidividual packages can still be compiled with specified flags or in debug mode using

make CFLAGS=-O2 some-package

or

make SAGE_DEBUG="yes" some-package

This ticket prepares #27122, which adds `-march=native` to the defaults.

One point that probably needs discussion is the following.

When an spkg is built, the current design of `sage-spkg` is to create a self-contained script `spkg-install` that sets all necessary environment variables (by sourcing `sage-env` etc.). (This makes it relatively easy to debug the installation process.)

Making package installs depend on exported environment variables in `Makefile.in` breaks this design.

It would probably be better to create a new script `sage-build-env` (to complement `sage-build-env-config`) to take care of these environment variable settings.

Ok, I think I'm beginning to understand.

Create a new file `build/bin/sage-build-env.in` and move the stuff that I added to the makefile there?

Then make sure `build/bin/sage-build-env` is added to the correct places?

Why should I not add the things to `build/bin/sage-build-env-config` directly?

Just a suggestion, to keep the analogy to `src/bin/sage-env` (which implements some logic) and `src/bin/sage-env-config` (which purely sets some variables).  Not very important.

I think I have mostly figured it out.

But it seems that this is no longer applied. If I configure with some `CFLAGS`, it seems that when making still the standard `CFLAGS` are applied. It is consistent with the `CFLAGS` in `sage -sh` at least.

Ok, I just went ahead an did this. It's a lot simpler now. Almost everything is at one place.
`configure.ac` needs to save the flags and `build/bin/sage-build-env-config.in` picks them up again as `CONFIGURED_CFLAGS` etc.

We run this to find out whether the configured Fortran compiler has a free form mode.

We do this for our decision whether we have to install gfortran or not.

But it must be up to the individual packages how they invoke the Fortran compiler.

Your proposed change does not work. `AC_PROG_CC()` changes the value of `CFLAGS` if not set. `AC_SUBST(CFLAGS, "$CFLAGS")` will implicitly set `CFLAGS` (even though possibly to the empty value), but prevents `AC_PROG_CC` from messing with it.
