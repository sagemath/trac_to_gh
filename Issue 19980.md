Many functions in `src/sage/libs/pari/pari_instance.pyx` are just manual copies of auto-generated code. Remove those functions, but keep the doctests in `src/sage/libs/pari/tests.py`.

I just doctested this. All tests pass.

I suggest one more removal: `default(self, variable, value=None)`.

Since the `default` function is to be dealt in #20224, I have no more objections.
