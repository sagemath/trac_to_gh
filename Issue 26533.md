Wouldn't it be better to just cut a new pynac bugfix release? Since it advertises itself as a "Sage Math support library" it  doesn't make much sense that sage would have to patch it.

I disagree, patching packages from within sage *is* a bad thing. It greatly increases the workload for packagers, breaks assumptions of users and may result in confusing upstream bug reports.

+1 we're trying to reduce the dependence on "sage-the-distribution" which has created an inordinate maintenance burden for the entire community.
