Wouldn't it be better to just cut a new pynac bugfix release? Since it advertises itself as a "Sage Math support library" it  doesn't make much sense that sage would have to patch it.

For some reason I thought this was already fixed--indeed the solution here would be to release a new pynac.

This is the best solution of course. My only question is when can we expect a new release?

Patching packages from within Sage is not a bad thing. I just hope my upcoming Pynac upgrade ticket gets more review than this one.

I disagree, patching packages from within sage *is* a bad thing. It greatly increases the workload for packagers, breaks assumptions of users and may result in confusing upstream bug reports. So at least from my point of view this did get reviewed, with the verdict being "lets just do a proper update instead".

+1 we're trying to reduce the dependence on "sage-the-distribution" which has created an inordinate maintenance burden for the entire community.

Ok then. Wontfix seems to be the majority view for this ticket
