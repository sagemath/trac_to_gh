Yes, whis is a clear duplicate of #12919, however, I would like to keep also the doctest of this patch, 12919 doctest is a an ad-hoc class for testing the bug. In this patch is a "real-life" situation where the bug is triggered.

Should I clear the patch to keep only the doctest and possibli be merged?
