CC:  @jdemeyer

Keywords: pari

In SageMath 8.2.beta8:

```
sage: pari('f(x)=f(x)')(0)
Segmentation fault
```

In GP, this causes a "deep recursion" error:

```
? f(x)=f(x)
%1 = (x)->f(x)
? f(0)
  ***   [...] at: f(x)
  ***             ^----
  ***   in function f: f(x)
  ***                  ^----
  ***   in function f: f(x)
  ***                  ^----
[...]
  ***   in function f: f(x)
  ***                  ^----
  ***   deep recursion.
```

This might be fixed by #21509.

Indeed, #21509 improves the situation:

```
sage: pari('f(x)=f(x)')(0)

cypari2/gen.pyx in cypari2.gen.Gen.eval()

This is not yet as informative as the GP "deep recursion" error.  I tried to do `sage --gdb` to find out where the segmentation fault comes from, but this appears to crash in cysignals on startup:

True, but it's not so easy to check whether a `SIGSEGV` was due to a stack overflow or another problem. Once a program has started, the stack is just a region of memory and overflowing the stack is the same as overflowing an allocated array.

I'm not saying that it's impossible to check specifically for stack overflows, but it's going to be a hack anyway. So I doubt that it is worth it.
