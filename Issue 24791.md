# Issue 24791: pari('f(x)=f(x)')(0) crashes Sage

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25028

Original creator: pbruin

Original creation time: 2018-03-23 12:05:20

CC:  jdemeyer

Keywords: pari

In SageMath 8.2.beta8:

```
sage: pari('f(x)=f(x)')(0)
Segmentation fault
```

In GP, this causes a "deep recursion" error:

```
? f(x)=f(x)
%1 = (x)->f(x)
? f(0)
  ***   [...] at: f(x)
  ***             ^----
  ***   in function f: f(x)
  ***                  ^----
  ***   in function f: f(x)
  ***                  ^----
[...]
  ***   in function f: f(x)
  ***                  ^----
  ***   deep recursion.
```

This might be fixed by #21509.

Indeed, #21509 improves the situation:

```
sage: pari('f(x)=f(x)')(0)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is not yet as informative as the GP "deep recursion" error.  I tried to do `sage --gdb` to find out where the segmentation fault comes from, but this appears to crash in cysignals on startup:

Replying to [comment:2 pbruin]:
> this appears to crash in cysignals on startup:

That `SIGFPE` is a feature, not a bug. You are not the first person to stumble over this. Unfortunately, I have no way to tell gdb "this `SIGFPE` is really part of the normal flow of execution, just ignore it".

True, but it's not so easy to check whether a `SIGSEGV` was due to a stack overflow or another problem. Once a program has started, the stack is just a region of memory and overflowing the stack is the same as overflowing an allocated array.

I'm not saying that it's impossible to check specifically for stack overflows, but it's going to be a hack anyway. So I doubt that it is worth it.

I see, cypari2 explicitly disables PARI's own stack checking.  It's probably not worth hacking together a substitute for this.
