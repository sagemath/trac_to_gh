# Issue 10464: Add functions about periods in the Words library

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10517

Original creator: abmasse

Original creation time: 2010-12-22 21:09:54

Assignee: sage-combinat

CC:  slabbe tmonteil tjolivet jleroy

Keywords: periods, words

There are already some functions in Sage dealing with the periods of a word, namely 

  1. `is_primitive(self)`, tells whether self is an integral power of another smaller word;
  1. `primitive(self)`, returns the smallest word `u` such that `self = u^n` and `n` is an integer;
  1. `primitive_length(self)`, returns the length of the primitive of self.

However, the two following functions are useful and should be added:

  1. `has_period(self, p)`, which returns True if `p` is a period of `self`;
  1. `periods(self)`, returns all the periods of `self`.

I should upload a patch soon with those two functions.

I added a new patch which I think should improve the code of the second method. I also fixed the syntax a NOTE block. I am ok with Alex patch. I allow him to set this ticket to positive review if he agrees with my changes.

Hi, Sébastien !

You're right, thank you for the improvement. I agree with all changes. I verified and all tests pass. I'm ready to set this ticket to positive review.

Problems while building the documentation:

```
/mnt/usb1/scratch/jdemeyer/merger/sage-4.7.alpha3/devel/sage/doc/en/reference/sage/combinat/words/finite_word.rst:: (ERROR/3) Content block expected for the "NOTE" directive; none found.
```

Replying to [comment:5 jdemeyer]:

Right. The line `NOTE:` should be replaced by `.. NOTE::` and the following paragraph should be indented.

I'm sorry, I missed that.

Actually, I fixed it in my review patch. Just forgot the indentation... So, I will post a patch for this right now.
