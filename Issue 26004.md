That shift is really just a hack to correct for the indexing set of the finite type. The correct thing to do is have `j = self.index_set().index(i)`. The way to optimize this is to store a

```
self._index_set_inverse = {ind: i for i,ind in enumerate(self.index_set())
```

in the parent that is constructed at initialization. Actually, this is probably better done as an ``@`lazy_attribute` in the `Crystals` category.
