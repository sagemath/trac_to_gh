In the [part about docbuilding](http://www.sagemath.org/doc/developer/sage_manuals.html#building), there is a small typo.

```
as explained below. Use the following command to obtain more documentation for the sage -docbuild script:

sage -docbuild -help
```

should have either `--help`, `-h`, or `--help-all` (the latter does something different.  The current thing does the same as `-h` but gives a Sphinx warning about the unknown option `e`.

Hmmm, so far only looked at the patch:

I would consistently use double dashs for all long options, i.e. `--docbuild`, since many people consider long options with a single dash deprecated, so we IMHO shouldn't encourage people to use the "old" form.

The quoted strings `"html"`, `"pdf"` etc. should IMHO be typeset as code, i.e. ```html```, ```pdf``` and the like.

I'd say *"for the options to `sage --docbuild`"* rather than *"for the `sage -docbuild` script"*.

[I'm aware or, more precisely, pretty sure that there are many further instances of the above in the Developer's Guide; I'd be happy with just changing them in the currently affected file, `sage_manuals.rst`.]




We should also somehow make sure the typos (if present) get fixed in the translations, though apparently there are no direct translations of this document / file, at least not in the current release.

IIRC a Russian translation is ready to get merged, and a not-that-ready German one rottens somewhere... ;-)

See, now you are asking me to change things that were not broken, presumably.  I just fixed the specific typos involved with help.

> The quoted strings `"html"`, `"pdf"` etc. should IMHO be typeset as code, i.e. ```html```, ```pdf``` and the like.

I thought about that, but again, it was a bigger change than I wanted to make.

That seems ok.

I would ask for a different ticket to fix all those things consistently.  I had time to make this patch, but not that bigger patch you are talking about (I'd rather review someone else's patches on other tickets).

Because long options with a single dash are odd in that they prevent us from using e.g. `sage -tlvp 4 ...` instead of `sage -tp 4 -long -verbose ...`.

Sage really wasn't designed very well regarding that.  (Worse, also the order matters; you e.g. cannot use `-s -i` instead of `-i -s`, nor `-is` or `-si`, and `-ba-force` is not an alternate form of `-b -a -f` or `--build --all --force`.)

Actually it's a Unix convention, from the very beginning, that you can specify `-aBc` as well as `-a -B -c` (having the same meaning).  Then the alternate long options (*always* with a double dash) came, although today a few do not even have a corresponding short form.

Regarding GCC, that to some extent depends on the interpretation; for example the various `-f`, `-m` and `-W` options can be considered taking (mandatory) arguments which immediately follow the (single letter) option, without a separator.  On the other hand, there are options like `-ansi`, `-pipe`, `-print-search-dirs`, `--target-help` and `--version`, where the former three of course *are* long options with only a single dash (and none of them take a parameter).
