For `9.7.beta0` when building the pdf documentation I have

```
Latexmk: List of undefined refs and citations:
  Reference `index:module-sage.combinat` on page 3675 undefined on input line 351794
```

And in `local/share/doc/sage/pdf/en/reference/combinat/combinat.pdf` on page 3675 (the **PYTHON MODULE INDEX** there is


```
c
sage.combinat, ??
```

```

Some additional info:

In `local/share/doc/sage/html/en/reference/py-modindex.html`, `sage.combinat` is a link that points back to the main `Combinatorics` webpage. 

In `local/share/doc/sage/latex/en/reference/combinat/combinat.idx` the first two lines are

```
\indexentry{module@\spxentry{module}!sage.combinat@\spxentry{sage.combinat}|hyperpage}{1}
\indexentry{sage.combinat@\spxentry{sage.combinat}!module@\spxentry{module}|hyperpage}{1}
```

which seems to be a correct location but that location did not make it into `local/share/doc/sage/pdf/en/reference/combinat/combinat.pdf`.

To resolve this I believe that perhaps something needs to be changed in `src/sage/combinat/all.py`. But I don't know enough about `sphinx` to correct things.
