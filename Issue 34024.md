Keywords: ideals

Their product is well-defined, but right now Sage does not allow this:

```
sage: MS = MatrixSpace(QQ,2,2)
sage: I = MS * [2*MS.0,3*MS.1] * MS
sage: I.side()
'twosided'
sage: I * I
...
NotImplementedError: Cannot multiply non-commutative ideals.
```

We fix this.

I don't think you should allow two-sided ideals as input, because the generating set of  a product of two-sided ideals is not just the product of the generating sets: `(RaR)(RbR)` may be much larger than `RabR` when `R` is not commutative. Therefore, I think you need to delete the line `or self.side() == other.side() == "twosided"`.
