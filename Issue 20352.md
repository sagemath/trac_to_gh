# Issue 20352: Add a link to the static documentation in Jupyter interactive help (?)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/20589

Querying the documentation of an object/method in the Jupyter
notebook, opens an help window. The goal of this ticket is to include
a link to the corresponding Sphinx-compiled static documentation when
it exists.

Notes for potential implementation:

The inventory objects obtained as side product of the Sphinx contains
appropriate information to retrieve the relevant html file name, and
the label is just the name of the object::


```
...
sage.combinat.composition.Compositions py:class 1 sage/combinat/composition.html#$ -
...
```


So we just need to scan those, and know the base url of the static html documentation.

I'm looking in to this. In any case, understanding the Jupyter help system better might also help with other kernels (https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/issues/96).

Possibly related to #19740?  (I.e., would this be necessary to deal with before having it as default?)

AFAIK, we did not have this feature in Sage's legacy notebook. In any cases, this is nice but not critical. No need to add this as dependency.

An older, related issue is #8482.  In that case one would want to produce a doc link to the SageNB's own online doc serving.

While I'm less concerned with this working in SageNB, that ticket does suggest that one would want a good way to customize the base URL for where to find the docs. It could also substitute in doc.sagemath.org if static docs are not available locally, which can be the case, especially in some OS distros that distribute the docs in a separate, optional package.
