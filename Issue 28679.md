Changing keywords from "" to "manifolds, mixed-forms".

This makes the coercion model of mixed forms more robust against modifications regarding differential forms. For instance: As soon as differential forms of _every_ degree have coerce maps, the mixed form has one too.

I spared the `try...except` block now completely. I think this is a negligible loss of computation time. Also this is more robust and works everytime.

Do you have some examples that demonstrates that this change now covers something that it didn't (correctly) do before? If so, please add them to the documentation, but if not, can you give a more detailed explanation as to why you think this is better?

Fair enough. I'm not sure this change covers even more at this stage.

The only improvement so far: There might be objects with a method `degree` which are not coercible into differential forms. Or conversely there are coercible objects without having a degree method (like elements of the symbolic ring). So I avoid invoking `degree` completely.

Assume in a future version there come more objects not having a `degree` method but are coercible into differential forms (I admit, I have no idea what else it could be). Nevertheless, these cases have to be handled separately now. But with this changes, all potential coercions are covered.

Was that clearer? What do you think about it? And how could I improve my description?

By the way: Merry christmas retrospectively. :)

Yes, that is more clear, thank you. So can you please add such an example that now coerces that previously did not?

Thank you, but can you add that example as a doctest?
