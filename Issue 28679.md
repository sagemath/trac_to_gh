Fair enough. I'm not sure this change covers even more at this stage.

The only improvement so far: There might be objects with a method `degree` which are not coercible into differential forms. Or conversely there are coercible objects without having a degree method (like elements of the symbolic ring). So I avoid invoking `degree` completely.

Assume in a future version there come more objects not having a `degree` method but are coercible into differential forms (I admit, I have no idea what else it could be). Nevertheless, these cases have to be handled separately now. But with this changes, all potential coercions are covered.

Was that clearer? What do you think about it? And how could I improve my description?

By the way: Merry christmas retrospectively. :)
