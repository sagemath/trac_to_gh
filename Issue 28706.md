Keywords: configure, eclib

Sage-9.0 is out which requires at least `eclib-20190909`. spkg-configure.m4 for eclib checks for version >=20190226. With system `eclib-20190226-r1` installed Sage builds without complaint. From `config.log`

```
configure:18419: result: yes; use eclib from the system
```

But with version 20190226 this doctest fails

In Sept 2019 I proposed a PR adding pkg-configure support to eclib: https://github.com/JohnCremona/eclib/pull/58

which is now in upstream. It should make version detection trivial.

Anyway, these failing tests are not something to worry about  too much, as far as I can see, there are about not very graceful error recovery or some warnings printed in wrong moments.
