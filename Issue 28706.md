# Issue 28706: spkg-configure.m4 for eclib does not check for correct version of the system installed library

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28943

Keywords: configure, eclib

Sage-9.0 is out which requires at least `eclib-20190909`. spkg-configure.m4 for eclib checks for version >=20190226. With system `eclib-20190226-r1` installed Sage builds without complaint. From `config.log`

```
configure:18419: result: yes; use eclib from the system
```

But with version 20190226 this doctest fails

```

Changing component from PLEASE CHANGE to build: configure.

In Sept 2019 I proposed a PR adding pkg-configure support to eclib: https://github.com/JohnCremona/eclib/pull/58

which is now in upstream. It should make version detection trivial.

Anyway, these failing tests are not something to worry about  too much, as far as I can see, there are about not very graceful error recovery or some warnings printed in wrong moments.

To me those failures don't look like a good reason to reject `eclib-20190226-r1`. How about just fixing those doctests?


---

Comment by dimpase created at 2020-04-12 04:58:52

I don't know how to make these tests to work for this and later versions at the same time, without making them weaker.


---

Comment by @kliem created at 2020-04-12 13:14:25

I see your point. E.g. in the first example we are really checking that something with the API works correctly. If we accept any type of `RuntimeError`, we don't check this anymore.

I don't if this is the right ticket for this comment: on an Ubuntu virtual machine, I happened to have `libec-dev` installed but not `eclib-tools`, so there was no `mwrank` executable. Sage did not detect this and used the system's `eclib` installation, `make` succeeded, but then there were naturally doctest failures. I don't know `m4` syntax, but it looks like it's checking for headers and libraries, not the presence of `mwrank`.

That could be done with `AC_CHECK_PROG[MWRANK,mwrank,has_mwrank=yes,has_mwrank=no,,]` or something like that. Using `AC_PATH_PROG` is also an option (the main difference is that it returns an absolute path to the executable).

Changing priority from major to blocker.

Comment by mkoeppe created at 2020-04-17 18:57:20

The check for mwrank definitely needs to be added for 9.1. I don't know about the other failures described on this ticket.

I have created #29526 for this.

Yes. The errors in the ticket description are reproduced on `ubuntu-eoan-standard` (https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/985563520)

If https://github.com/JohnCremona/eclib/pull/58 solves the issue then perhaps `eclib` should be patched until a newer version is available.

This calls for a bug report to the distribution that is packaging the faulty eclib.

The pull request [https://github.com/JohnCremona/eclib/pull/58](https://github.com/JohnCremona/eclib/pull/58) appears to be in `eclib-20210226`, the current version at [https://github.com/JohnCremona/eclib](https://github.com/JohnCremona/eclib). Perhaps this ticket should be closed and work started on upgrading `eclib`, i.e. #31443.

Superseded by #31443.
