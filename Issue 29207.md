I tested this upgrade on debian buster and all tests passed (`sage -t --long -all`), except for one that has nothing to do with this ticket:


```
sage -t --long src/sage/env.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/env.py", line 15, in sage.env
Failed example:
    out == repr((SAGE_ROOT, SAGE_LOCAL))                                        # long time
Expected:
    True
Got:
    False
```

(I have something set up with a symlink and the test doesn't test equal, even though it is de facto the same location, probably incorrect setup but irrelevant here.)
