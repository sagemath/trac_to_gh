Presumably, you get that on OS X. Which version?

The problem seems to be the parentheses inside the `[ ... ]` which should be quoted but which are really not needed here in the first place.

I see, they must have been a late addition because there is no way I didn't at least test that it built with gcc and clang on a linux box.
