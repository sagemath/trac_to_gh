For broader coverage of platforms you could push a tag to GitHub so that the GH actions CI infrastructure is run on this ticket...

Those crashes are on brial - I'm pretty sure they are caused by using system brial compiled with GCC 10 and running against sage's stdlib from GCC 9. brial is very sensitive to the GCC version it is compiled with - if system GCC is not being used, system brial shouldn't be used either.
