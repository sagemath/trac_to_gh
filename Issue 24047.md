# Issue 24047: Exclude some functions with arg restrictions from random testing

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24284

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2017-11-27 06:58:27

Rare doctest errors can happen in `random_expression` if functions are selected that raise errors on wrong argument type. This ticket excludes all (up to now) known such functions from being used in `random_expression`.
