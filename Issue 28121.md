The specific example is this:

```
sage: plot(prime_pi,3,100,xmin=5)
TypeError: plot() got multiple values for keyword argument 'min'
```
which clearly is because `prime_pi.plot` has a predefined `xmin`.  This should be handled gracefully, since 

```
sage: plot(prime_pi,3,100).show(xmin=5)
```
has no problems, since the `show` method is separate from the actual plot creation.

Probably some other functions like euler, moebius, or some others will have this problem.
