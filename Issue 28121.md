# Issue 28121: functions with predefined plot methods may have keyword collision

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/28358

Original creator: kcrisman

Original creation time: 2019-08-15 15:19:31

The specific example is this:

```
sage: plot(prime_pi,3,100,xmin=5)
TypeError: plot() got multiple values for keyword argument 'min'
```

which clearly is because `prime_pi.plot` has a predefined `xmin`.  This should be handled gracefully, since 

```
sage: plot(prime_pi,3,100).show(xmin=5)
```

has no problems, since the `show` method is separate from the actual plot creation.

Probably some other functions like euler, moebius, or some others will have this problem.
