ECL we ship is very old. Here is an update to the current stable version.

* ECL git [here](https://gitlab.com/embeddable-common-lisp/ecl.git) and apparently the tarball
  can be obtained [there](https://gitlab.com/embeddable-common-lisp/ecl/repository/archive.tar.gz?ref=ECL.15.3.7), too. But it is not useful without renaming, etc.

ecl tarball to use is [here](http://users.ox.ac.uk/~coml0531/sage/ecl-15.3.7.tar.bz2)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18961

I thought you were going to update `spkg-src` to run autotools, have I been mistaken on that point? Other than that I cannot really check the patch for cygwin but I am assuming they would be OK. The other stuff done to the tarball and then as a consequence to the `configure` script are a bit extreme in my view but I can keep to the status quo.

I don't know, tell me if this is OK, or not...

`sage-src` point is that we ship a modified tarball and it helps generate it. In my opinion running autoreconf is fair game. You have to remember `spkg-src` is not run by the user building sage only by the packager providing a new version of the package.

That being said the change allowed in are only things that are not trivial:
* removal of files (making a smaller tarball, `gap` anyone?)
* regeneration of script (autoreconf is a case in point if the changes are not easily patched back into `configure` and al. It is generally cleaner.)

Whether you want to exercise the second bullet point is at your discretion. I didn't for the last `singular` patch, but it was a trivial change.
