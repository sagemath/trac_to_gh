ECL we ship is very old. Here is an update to the current stable version.

 * ECL git [here](https://gitlab.com/embeddable-common-lisp/ecl.git) and apparently the tarball
  can be obtained [there](https://gitlab.com/embeddable-common-lisp/ecl/repository/archive.tar.gz?ref=ECL.15.3.7), too. But it is not useful without renaming, etc.

ecl tarball to use is [here](http://users.ox.ac.uk/~coml0531/sage/ecl-15.3.7.tar.bz2)

I thought you were going to update `spkg-src` to run autotools, have I been mistaken on that point? Other than that I cannot really check the patch for cygwin but I am assuming they would be OK. The other stuff done to the tarball and then as a consequence to the `configure` script are a bit extreme in my view but I can keep to the status quo.

Right, thanks for reminding me. I'll update spkg-src.

But running autoconf in spkg-src would only make sense if almost all patches are applied already. So in effect we are creating a modified tarball, if we are not willing to have autoconf as a dependence.

I don't know, tell me if this is OK, or not...

PS. On the other hand I can just do patching in spkg-src and again in spkg-install.

`sage-src` point is that we ship a modified tarball and it helps generate it. In my opinion running autoreconf is fair game. You have to remember `spkg-src` is not run by the user building sage only by the packager providing a new version of the package.

That being said the change allowed in are only things that are not trivial:
 * removal of files (making a smaller tarball, `gap` anyone?)
 * regeneration of script (autoreconf is a case in point if the changes are not easily patched back into `configure` and al. It is generally cleaner.)

Whether you want to exercise the second bullet point is at your discretion. I didn't for the last `singular` patch, but it was a trivial change.

OK, done; I have moved all the patching into spkg-src, and further updated it to make creation of the tarball etc as automatic as I can. As a byproduct, spkg-install is simpler.

oops, wrong tarball naming...

Sorry to be a pain but I would like you to add a comment in SPKG.txt that from this release all the patches are applied in `spkg-src` and therefore do not need to be applied in `spkg-install`. I would go as far as adding a comment in `spkg-install` signalling that patches are already applied from `spkg-src`. I believe that's the first package to take a total inclusion course from `spkg-src` in this way.

OK, done. Took a while to find and remove an evil "continue" from spkg-src... :-)

Thank you. I am a bit behind in term of my sage work. I maintain sage-on-gentoo as a priority but various pressures interfere with my work here. I will try to complete this review today by testing on a Mac where I think the potential for problem is the greatest.

All build and basic tests related to maxima and ecl passed, however I want to check what's happening with libffi before giving this a tick. libffi is normally present in some form on system we build sage (otherwise python's ctype wouldn't be built and then numpy wouldn't build I think).

So I think the old `ecl` was picking the system libffi without help while we now have to explicitly ask for it. I definitely think we should use libffi if available. I am surprised it built properly without actually - may be it got picked even so there was a visible message in configure.

OK it was always the case that libffi wasn't found on OS X at least.
