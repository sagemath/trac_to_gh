CC:  @johanrosenkilde

For now, there is no structure to easily add errors in codewords. If one wants to experiment with decoding algorithms on codes, the only possible way is to add errors "by hand", which is rather tedious.

We propose here a new structure, based on communication channels, on purpose to facilitate the experimentation process with decoding algorithms.

For now, our structure consists of:

- an abstract class for channels,
- a channel which adds a specific number of errors at random positions to each provided vector
- a channel which adds a specific number of errors at random positions to each provided vector, and erases a specific number of random positions

With this new structure, creating `n` errors in a vector can be done in one line of code into Sage.
Adding a new Channel class should also be easy: all one needs to do is to inherit from the abstract class, and override and implement a method.

For better consistency, channels can only be accessed using channels.<name> (see #15445) from the global namespace.

Hello,

1. You might consider inheriting from `SageObject` (`sage.structure.sage_object`).

2. I would rather hide them under `codes.channels.<name>`. That way you can avoid the file `channels_catalog`.

3. Why `sage.coding.channel_constructions` and not `sage.coding.channels`?

4. Why not setting `__call__` as an alias of `transmit`. That would allow

```
sage: channel(msg)
```

  which is convenient.

5. Would be cool to have cross references with actual codes in the documentation. Right now the documentation looks like this is an isolated block.

6. You could add various tests to check that if you reset the seed you get the same answer. Might be useful to have this doctested and also for users to know that they can use it.

```
sage: set_random_seed(10)
sage: randint(0,5)
5
sage: set_random_seed(10)
sage: randint(0,5)
5
sage: set_random_seed(10)
sage: randint(0,5)
5
```


7. In `_random_error_vector` why not starting with

```
vect = [F.random_element() for _ in range(n)]
```


8. The functions `_random_error_position`, `_random_error_vector` and `_tuple_to_integer` will not appear in the documentation. You should either remove the `_` at the begining or add some `automethod` sphinx directives (you have to look in the code to find how to do it)

9. The function `_random_error_position` should be moved to `prandom`. It is useful in its own and quite independent. Note that it is quite similar to

```
sage: sample(range(10), 4)
[1, 7, 6, 4]
```


10. For `_random_error_vector` I would rather use `F._nonzero_random_element()` that is useful in your case

```
sage: GF(2)._random_nonzero_element()
1
```

   of course the default implementation is to call `.random_element` until something nonzero is found. Hence you can use

11. Why do you need this `_tuple_to_integer`? Why not using directly `randint(*value)`?

```
sage: value = [0,5]
sage: randint(*value)
3
sage: value = (0,5)
sage: randint(*value)
4
```


Eleven is a nice prime number. So I will stop there.

Vincent

Hello,

Thank you for the input!

My idea here was to mimic the way codes were stored and hide: a code_constructions file for the codes, and a codes_catalog file for the list of codes. I wanted to do the same with channels for consistency. That's why I chose the name channel_constructions.
Hiding the channels under codes.channels.<name> might be confusing (imho): one can think that channels depends on codes, which is not the case as they are completely independant objects. So they can be used on any vector, not only on codewords, or for experimentation on decoding. Which also explains why the documentation looks like an isolated block, I wrote it as a new object, independant from codes.

>The functions `_random_error_position`, `_random_error_vector` and `_tuple_to_integer` will not appear in the documentation. You should either remove the `_` at the begining or add some `automethod` sphinx directives (you have to look in the code to find how to do it) 

Well, that was done on purpose as one should not use these methods except when implementing a new Channel object. Now, with a second thought about this, it's not that smart as one will have to browse through the code to find these methods. I think I'll remove the underscore to make them appear in the doc, while putting the statement "This is a helper function, for internal use only." in a `..NOTE::` block to highlight this.

For the rest of your comments, thanks a lot for the advice on these `random` issues. I'll change the code accordingly.

```
def sample_range(n, k):

In the same function you should also:
- check the input (just do `n = int(n); k = int(k)`)
- rename the variable `error_position` into something more meaningful

I did some changes, as stated by commit messages above.

Some remarks:

- I kept `tuple_to_integer` because the user can pass either an integer or an interval as `number_errors` parameter for the channels. If the user passes an integer, then `randint` won't work. Of course it is possible to do the check anytime you call `number_errors` (if integer, return it, else do a randint and return the result) but it's rather tedious. Especially because it's something that will be used by a some channels. I think it's easier to call a single method rather than copying the `if` statement each time. Maybe `tuple_to_integer` is not really a good name though.

- `random_error_vector(n, F, error_positions)` returns a vector of length `n` over `F` with `0`s in every position except those listed in `error_positions`. Because of this, calling `vect = [F.random_element() for _ in range(n)]` in `random_error_vector` does not really fit, because it will create a vector with non-controlled zero positions, so we'll need to set all positions except those into `error_positions` afterwards. I think create a zero vector of size `n` and add random values at some positions is better.

- I did not change the documentation, nor the catalog stuff (see comment 4). If you think that Channels are actually more linked to codes than to anything else, I can make some changes.

The name is very bad. Moreover you can convert an integer `a` into the tuple `(a,a)` in the constructor. With your way of doing it you avoid the function call to `randint` but with your version you always add an extra function call to `tuple_to_integer`.

You should replace all occurrence of `hasattr(X, '__iter__')` by `isinstance(X, (tuple, list))`. Having an `__iter__` method does not charaterize tuples.

Yes. You are right!

You should tell me ;-) Cryptogtaphers might like it but they do use strings
not vectors in a vector space over a finite field.

12. When you do `__call__ = transmit` the documentation is copied as well. Did you try

```
sage: Chan = channels.StaticErrorRateChannel(GF(11), 2)
sage: Chan.__call__?
```


13. I would rather implement `StaticErrorRateChannel.transmit_unsafe` as

```
def transmit_unsafe(self, msg):

  it would be more direct. Moreover it shows that `sample_range` would better be an iterator instead of returning a list. By the way, this function `sample_range` has currently linear complexity in `n`, isn't it possible to make it linear in `k`?

14. In the main documentation class, it is useful to document the main methods. In other words, when reading `sage: channels.StaticErrorChannel?` I should be able to discvoer the method `transmit` (and its alias usage with `__call__`).

25. In the very top documentation, you can have links by writing `class:`AbstractChannel`` instead of `*AbstractChannel*`.

Yes it is (the solution is not exactly linear though)

```
sage: S = Subsets(100,4)
sage: timeit("S.random_element()")
625 loops, best of 3: 54.2 µs per loop
sage: timeit("sample_range(100,4)")

sage: S = Subsets(1000,4)
sage: timeit("S.random_element()")
625 loops, best of 3: 61.2 µs per loop
sage: timeit("sample_range(1000,4)")
625 loops, best of 3: 510 µs per loop
```

It is roughly the same speed for `n=100` but for `n=1000` yours is twice slower.

This code for subsets is just using

```
sage: sample(range(n), k)
```

So I guess this is currently the best way to do it. And moreover, looking at Python doc

```
    To choose a sample in a range of integers, use xrange as an argument.
    This is especially fast and space efficient for sampling from a
    large population:   sample(xrange(10000000), 60)
```

Sorry for my previous remarks. You should just get rid of `sample_range(n,k)` and use `sample(xrange(n),k)`.

Hello,

16. I do not like this `AbstractChannel`. If you look `Morphism` the top (abstract) class is not `AbstractMorphism` but `Morphism` (see `sage.categories.morphism.Morphism`).

27. In my remark 12 I was suggesting to actually remove

```
def __call__(self, msg):
    return self.transmit(msg)
```

  and keep only

```
__call__ = transmit
```

  It avoids duplication of the documentation.

18. You can remove the `raise NotImplementedError` in the abstract method. By construction

```
sage: class A:
....:     @abstract_method
....:     def ploum_ploum(self):
....:         "a hello function!"
sage: a = A()
sage: a.ploum_ploum()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
NotImplementedError: <abstract method ploum_ploum at 0x7f1db2e02758>
```


19. In

```
ValueError: The total number of errors and erasures can
exceed the dimension of the input space
```

  shouldn't it be `can not`?

20. Do you really care about equality (i.e. the method `__eq__`)? If you do not then remove the method. If you do then you must also implement `__ne__` (and possibly `__hash__`). Otherwise

```
sage: class A:
....:     def __eq__(self, other):
....:         return True
sage: a = A()
sage: b = A()
sage: a == b
True
sage: a != b
True
```


Further remarks for later:

- If you look at the table of contents of coding you have

```
- Index of Channels
- Channels
- Index of Codes
- Linear Codes
...
```

  Not very nice. Though not for this ticket. Think about it for later on the table of contents of code documentation is a mess! But of course the priority is to clean the code.

- A more global remark: it is generally a bad strategy to implement an isolated block of code and then to try to mix things later. Especially if the code in itself is basically useless.

Hello,

For Sage objects, you should use `_repr_` and not `__repr__`. It is useful for example if you want to set a custom name

```
sage: class A(SageObject):
....:     def _repr_(self):
....:         return "Default repr"
sage: a = A()
Default repr
sage: a.rename('I am not me')
sage: a
I am not me
sage: a.rename(None)
sage: a
Default repr
```

There are two occurrences + one mention in the documentation.

Beyond that it looks good!

21. In each class/function/method the documentation should be:
   - one line description
   - then more details in one or several paragraphs if needed. It is not the case in `StaticErrorRateChannel` and `ErrorErasureChannel`.

   Moreover, in a class you should not write as a description `Construct a X`. It is rather simply `X`. The reason is because it is the documentation of the class itself that you will see with:

```
sage: Chan = channels.ErrorErasureChannel(GF(59)^40, 2, 2)
sage: Chan?<enter>
```

  (BTW there is a nice short cut to build vector spaces: `K^n` just works!)

22. You can simplify a bit the `ErrorErasureChannel._repr_`. By doing things in two parts

```
def format_interval(t):
    return str(t[0]) if t[0] == t[1] else 'between %s and %s' %(t[0], t[1])

def _repr_():
    return "Error-and-erasure channel creating %s errors and %s erasures' %(
              format_interval(self.number_errors()),
              format_interval(self.number_erasures()))
```

  And if you really care about pluralization

```
def format_interval(t, singular, plural):
    name = singular if t[1] < 2 else plural
    if t[0] == t[1]:
        return '%s %s' %(t[0], name)
    else:
        return 'between %s and %s %s' %(t[0], t[1], name)
```

  Such `format_interval` can be used in all your `_repr_` methods.

23. You can simplify `ErrorErasureChannel.transmit_unsafe`. Notice that the output of `sample` is already randomized (you can have a look at the code source which is pure python) and it is specified in its documentation

```
The resulting list is in selection order so that
all sub-slices will also be valid random samples
```

 Hence, you can simply cut your errors into two parts as

```
errors = sample(xrange(n), number_errors + number_erasures)
error_positions   = errors[:number_errors]
erasure_positions = errors[number_errors:]
```

Salut David,

All right! This ticket is good to go.

That would be nice to start reviewing other's ticket as well. You can have a look at [the section "Reviewer Checklist" in the Sage's Developer Guide](http://sagemath.org/doc/developer/reviewer_checklist.html#chapter-review). If you want to start slowly, there are some tickets that are marked "beginner". Basically: one of your ticket gets reviewed -> you review one ticket.

Best,
Vincent
