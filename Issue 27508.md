The `lrslib` issue with `openmpi` is fixed (self-tests pass).

If i do `export MAKE='make -j4'` before running `sage -i -f polymake`, the compilation still eats all my CPU, though `spkg-install.in` relies on `sdh_make`.

Also, i have 6G free on my machine, and the compilation ends up with a `No space left on device`. How much disk space is required to build and install `polymake` ?

Matthias linked it to `SAGE_NUM_THREADS`, but it is might indeed be better to link it to what `MAKE` sets. I am letting mine compile with 2 threads right now since 4 still ate through 10+Gb RAM.

I was able to build both packages (thank you Matthias for your help with this). However, there are issues with `interfaces/polymake.py` (make sure you run `sage -tp --optional=sage,polymake`). The biggest issue is that it doesn't even finish evaluating the first doctest:

```
polymake.eval('print foo;')
```

It timed out after running for 5 minutes.

I tried running this directly in my Sage shell, which it is still taking seemingly forever. I also tried `C = polymake('cube(3)')`, which after I hit ctrl-c, any additional attempt to run the interface results in multiple errors of the form:

```
TypeError: argument should be integer or bytes-like object, not 'str'
```


Is this an issue with the interface? Is this something with polymake trying to do something for the first time? Something else?

The branch just has one commit that cleans up the interface file a bit.

Thanks for the help above. So I have polymake installed now and it works in `sage -sh`.

However, I'm getting an EOF error whenever I want to do something in sage, e.g. `polytopes.cube(backend='polymake').

Replying to [comment:71 gh-kliem]:
> However, I'm getting an EOF error whenever I want to do something in sage, e.g. `polytopes.cube(backend='polymake').

in `sage.interfaces.polymake` we have both `polymake_expect` and `polymake_jupymake` so which one is used in `polytopes.cube(backend='polymake')`?

How to tell `sage` I always want `polymake_jupymake` for every `something(backend='polymake')`?

I believe the issue with `_test_lawrence()` is numerical instability. Consider

```
sage: p = Polyhedron(vertices=[(-1,-1), (1,0), (1,1), (0,1)], backend='polymake')
sage: from sage.misc.prandom import randint 
sage: v = p.vertices()[randint(0, p.n_vertices()-1)].vector()
sage: Q = p.lawrence_extension(2*v - p.center())
sage: R = p.lawrence_extension(2.0*v - p.center())
```

Using floating point numbers seems to lead to issues with the conversion back and forth as

```
sage: Q.Hrepresentation()

 An inequality (-8, 16, -19) x + 8 >= 0,
 An inequality (-8, 0, -5) x + 8 >= 0,
 An inequality (-3, -5, 0) x + 8 >= 0,
 An inequality (0, -4, 3) x + 4 >= 0)

 An inequality (0.0, 0.0, 1.0) x + 0.0 >= 0)
```

This agrees with the backend information created from polymake, but how the faces are computed in Sage are different:

```
sage: Q.facets()                                                                                          
(A 2-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in QQ^3 defined as the convex hull of 3 vertices,
 A 2-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in QQ^3 defined as the convex hull of 3 vertices,
 A 2-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in QQ^3 defined as the convex hull of 3 vertices,
 A 2-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in QQ^3 defined as the convex hull of 3 vertices,
 A 2-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in QQ^3 defined as the convex hull of 3 vertices,
 A 2-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in QQ^3 defined as the convex hull of 3 vertices,
 A 2-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in QQ^3 defined as the convex hull of 4 vertices)
sage: R.facets()                                                                                          
(A 2-dimensional face of a Polyhedron in RDF^3 defined as the convex hull of 4 vertices,)
```

which is based off `R.combinatorial_polyhedron()`. In particular, if we try

```
sage: R.combinatorial_polyhedron().hasse_diagram()
...
ValueError: not all facets are joins of vertices
sage: R.combinatorial_polyhedron().hasse_diagram()
```

----
Based off this, what I would do is explicitly skip the test and state that it is a known issue with numerical instability. I am not sure what else we can do about fixing it at this point `:/`.

Do I understand correctly that Travis' remarks explain the error?

No, the failure in `_test_lawrence` shows up both for the `PolymakeExpect` and for the `PolymakeJupymake` interface.

`PolymakeExpect` has additional failures, which I do not know how to fix.

Well it works well except for all doctests in `interfaces/polymake.py` involing `PolymakeExpect`. Maybe we should mark them as `not tested` until the bug is fixed?

Also we could catch the long `EOF` traceback, which has the deprecation warning hidden all the way at the top with something like:


```diff
-            self._change_prompt("polytope > ")
-            Expect._start(self, alt_message=None)

+                Expect._start(self, alt_message=None)
+            except RuntimeError:
+                raise RuntimeError("runtime error with deprecated pexpect-base interface to polymake; please install jupymake")

`polymake` has specific options for precomputed data, so that it takes the input unconditionally.

If we do not use it, our pickling/unpickling is even worse than recreating the polytope:
