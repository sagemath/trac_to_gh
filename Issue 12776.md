Keywords: r-project

One of many example of how this doesn't work.  In order to do

```
    subset(cars, select = speed)
```

you need to do the not very Sage-like

```
    sage: r.new("subset(cars,select=speed)")
```

because otherwise you have

```
sage: r.subset("cars",select='speed')
Error: object 'sage2' not found
sage: r.subset(r.cars,select='speed')
['sage2']
```

See [this ask.sagemath question](http://ask.sagemath.org/question/1415/is-there-more-documentation-about-how-to-call-r-in) for this example, but this happens a lot with keywords, you almost have to just substitute them in by hand.

Diagnosis: in R interface we have

```
    def function_call(self, function, args=None, kwds=None):
        args, kwds = self._convert_args_kwds(args, kwds)
        self._check_valid_function_name(function)
        return self.new("%s(%s)"%(function, ",".join([s.name() for s in args] +
                                                     [self._sage_to_r_name(key)+'='+kwds[key].name() for key in kwds ] )))
```

and notice that `interface._convert_arg_kwds` "Converts all of the args and kwds to be elements of this interface.", which in this case is inappropriate.

I'm not sure what the best fix is, but at any rate changing to

```
#        args, kwds = self._convert_args_kwds(args, kwds)
        self._check_valid_function_name(function)
        return self.new("%s(%s)"%(function, ",".join([s for s in args] +
                                                     [self._sage_to_r_name(key)+'='+kwds[key] for key in kwds ] )))
```

allows

```
sage: r.subset("cars",select='speed')
```

to work, though it can't be a final solution since it breaks

```
sage: r.subset(r.cars,select='speed')
```

which should also work, in principle.

The current way to do this is


```
r('cars').subset(select='"speed"')
```


You need to use double quotes for strings when passing them into the interface.  Otherwise, `speed` will be treated as an "identifier" rather than a string.  There were some thought on changing this, but it is backwards incompatible and should be made consistent across interfaces.

Additionally, 

```
r('cars')['"speed"']
```

also works.
