Check out this

```
sage: F.<a> = NumberField(x^2-x-1)
sage: E = EllipticCurve([1,a+1,a,a,0])
sage: E.simon_two_descent()
(0, 1, [(-1 : -a + 1 : 1), (-a : 0 : 1)])
```


According to the docs:

```
Computes lower and upper bounds on the rank of the Mordell-Weil group, and a list of independent points.
```


It output a lower bound of 0, an upper bound of 1, and gave *two* independent points?  Clearly something is wrong.  In fact, the points output are all torsion and one is a multiple of the other:

```
sage: E.torsion_subgroup()
Torsion Subgroup isomorphic to Z/8 associated to the Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + x*y + a*y = x^3 + (a+1)*x^2 + a*x over Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 - x - 1
sage: Q == 4*P
True
sage: v = E.simon_two_descent()
sage: P,Q =v[2]
sage: Q == 4*P
True
sage: P.order()
8
sage: Q.order()
2
```


So instead of claiming the output points are independent, claim nothing about them?

Since it's doing a 2-descent the code should be able to guarantee that the points returned generate E(k)/2E(k) and should be able to test that the points form a basis of E(k)/2E(k) as an F_2-vector space. That's a kind of independence ...

Incidentally, from a 2-(isogeny-)descent on E one can conclude that the rank is 0, so while the upper bound returned does not contradict the documentation, the code is not returning the appropriate bound.
In Magma:
> RankBound(EllipticCurve([1,a+1,a,a,0]));
0
> AnalyticRank(E);
0 0.359929
but you probably already knew that.
