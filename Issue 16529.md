It seems that there will be a release very soon, and it would be a pity to show a bad doc to the world. Especially when everybody will find our new design stuff incredible ! `:-P`

(pleasepleasepleaseplease if you can review it fast, help meeeee !!)

Oops. Sorry. It was broken by #16597.

Fixed !

Always use `Return ...` instead of `Returns ...`

HMmmmmm `:-P`


```
~/sage/combinat/designs$ grep "returns " . -R | wc -l
172
```

I'm talking about the start of the docstring title (upper case), see
http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/#one-line-docstrings

Replying to [comment:10 vbraun]:

Yes this seems clear.
 
But how about lines like:

```
Construction 1	two_n()	Returns a Steiner Quadruple System on 2n points
```

I'd say, make it either  `Return`, or `returns`.

Since this is a table, I would make the third column follow the docstring conventions. Clearly Nathan intended to tabulate the docstring titles there. If it were a single sentence ("Construction 1 returns a Steiner Quadruple System") then lower-case and with "s" because of grammar.

more typos: in several places you have

```
Obtained form the La Jolla Covering Repository
```

which should be 

```
Obtained from the La Jolla Covering Repository
```

Changing status from needs_review to positive_review.

Lastly, I don't know whether that (1,2...,5) in the following

```
[Hanani60]	(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) Haim Hanani, On quadruple systems...
```

is how it should be. (Actually, indeed, there are 5 occurences of [Hanani60]_ in the text, but why this should be typeset like this by Sphinx, I have no idea.
If this can be fixed (in another ticket), it should.

Good enough for a positive review.

Yoooooooooo !!

I have always seen it like that. And I don't get why either (who needs backward links ?...)
