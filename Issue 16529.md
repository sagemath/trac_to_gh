It seems that there will be a release very soon, and it would be a pity to show a bad doc to the world. Especially when everybody will find our new design stuff incredible ! `:-P`

(pleasepleasepleaseplease if you can review it fast, help meeeee !!)

Yes this seems clear.
 
But how about lines like:

```
Construction 1	two_n()	Returns a Steiner Quadruple System on 2n points
```

I'd say, make it either  `Return`, or `returns`.
