Keywords: matrix subdivide copy

The `.subdivide` matrix method acts in place.  There are situations when a copy, with the subdivisions, is desirable.  An optional keyword, `copy` will provide this option.

I'd like to have the `sage_input()` command preserve the subdivisions of matrix.  So the output of `sage_input(A)` could be something like


```
matrix(QQ, [[1,2,3], [4,5,6]]).subdivide([1], [2], copy=True)
```


**presuming** the copy option proposed here was functional.  So this ticket is a precursor to the upcoming `sage_input` ticket.  Work on the present ticket is close to finished.

What do you think? Is it worth opening a thread on sage-devel?

Dear Vincent,

Thanks for looking at this, and for the excellent grep'ing skills.  Sorry I didn't get to this right away.

Well, it looks like `inplace` wins by frequency.   But a discussion on sage-devel might prove interesting.  I'm in no hurry.  And maybe others can point to the discussion later (or have it go in the developer's guide now).

I'll be at Sage Days next week (arriving a bit late), so that would be a good time to finish this one off if there is a consensus.

Thanks,
Rob

Hi Rob,

As I actually said on sage-devel, I would like to keep the following semantics for `inplace/copy`:
- `inplace`: modify (or not) the object, like `l.remove(1)` is an inplace modification on a list `l`;
- `copy`: whether the created object will hold the argument or make a copy of them, like `matrix(ZZ, data=[1,2,3,4], copy=False)`.

For the purpose of this ticket, this would be an `inplace`.

Vincent

Dear Vincent,

Back from vacation and now at Sage Days 68 for a few days before classes begin.

What do you think of Volker's suggestion that there could be a `.subdivided()` method, which would return a changed copy?  That sounds like a good solution to me.
