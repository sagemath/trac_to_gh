# Issue 32209: fix doctest formatting in schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_curve_isogeny.py

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/32446

Original creator: lorenz

Original creation time: 2021-09-01 10:39:32

The doctest for #17293 in `schemes/elliptic_curves/ell_curve_isogeny.py` is indented, but preceded by a line ending in a single `:`. This results in broken rendering in the HTML documentation.
