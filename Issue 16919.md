Keywords: immutable graph

We currently have the following:

```
sage: D = DiGraph([[1, 2]], immutable=True)
sage: Graph(D)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NotImplementedError                       Traceback (most recent call last)
...
NotImplementedError: An immutable graph does not change name
```
For the record, this works

```
sage: D = DiGraph([[1, 2]])
sage: Graph(D)
Graph on 2 vertices
```

I'm also wondering about the error type of (attempted) mutations of immutable (di)graphs. Some raise a `ValueError`, others raise a `NotImplementedError`. This needs to be made consistent at some point.

That's because two functions have been implemented by an idiot, and this idiot is me. Fix in 30 minutes at most.

Here it is. Besides, for some reason the 'sparse' keyword was deprecated in `DiGraph.to_undirected` but not in `Graph.to_directed`, to be replaced by 'data_structure'. As the !Graph/DiGraph constructors both have the two arguments, I chose to "solve that" by removing the deprecation in DiGraph. That is the second commit.

`NotImplementedError` is certainly not right, it seems to imply that it could get implemented someday. I also find `ValueError` dubious, since there is not really a "value" which is wrong.

I would actually vote for `TypeError`, which is what you get when you an operation which is not supported on some type, similar to

```
>>> "aaa"/3
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'str' and 'int'
```
