Keywords: complex interval, CIF, Riemann zeta function

For an upcoming paper, we need Riemann's zeta function in complex interval fields.

Here is a patch implementing it; with an emphasis on real part >= 0 (that is the situation we actually need).

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16782

> Riemann zeta for complex intervals could also be implemented using the Arb library (#16747).

Thank you for pointing that out; once #16747 is included and there are conversions between CIF and arb, that would certainly be the better option.
