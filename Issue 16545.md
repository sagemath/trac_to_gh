Keywords: complex interval, CIF, Riemann zeta function

For an upcoming paper, we need Riemann's zeta function in complex interval fields.

Here is a patch implementing it; with an emphasis on real part >= 0 (that is the situation we actually need).

I do have a TeX file containing additional (boring) computations documenting parts of the code, but I am not sure where to put it, see my post on [sage-devel](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/n1YtulIuaF8/a16pTD6XuRAJ).

Riemann zeta for complex intervals could also be implemented using the Arb library (#16747).

Replying to [comment:4 fredrik.johansson]:
> Riemann zeta for complex intervals could also be implemented using the Arb library (#16747).

Thank you for pointing that out; once #16747 is included and there are conversions between CIF and arb, that would certainly be the better option.

Deleted the branch as it was not the way to proceed.
