`sage -t --debug`, a new doctesting feature introduced by #12415, doesn't work for me on OS X 10.6.8 (it starts the tests but then just hangs). Strangely, the tests in `sage.doctest.forker.SageDocTestRunner.report_unexpected_exception` seem to succeed. I haven't tried running tests in debug mode since Jeroen changed the backend in [attachment:attachment.12415_review.patch:ticket:12415]; can anyone else duplicate this problem on another platform?

Did you check that it is really [attachment:12415_review.patch:ticket:12415] which breaks this and not one of the subsequent patches in #12415?

Adding back

```
import readline
```

in `init_sage()` seems to solve the problem.

Thanks for figuring out what was causing this.  The only change I would suggest is using 

```
:trac:`14249`
```

rather than

```
http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/14289

I think that

```
:trac:`14249`
```

should be used in and only in docstrings.

So I propose to leave the comment (unless you prefer `Trac #14289` to the full URL).
