Right now the .basis() methd returns the rows of a matrix, which naturally have no ambiant space and only the methods of `list`. This branch makes it an alias of `generator_matrix` (it used to be an alias of `.gens()`) so that this information remains available.

Note that this matrix is also an iterable, and that one can as easily iterate on the rows of that matrix as on the elements of the list it previously returned.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19251

Hello,

Just a question: if you're not adding a deprecation warning to this (which I agree with), what do you think about adding extra info to the docstring, like
"Returns a basis of `self` as a matrix of the ambient space of `self`"?

Doctests fail.

Also, a matrix is not a basis. Matrices have row and column spans, its not clear which one you mean if you just return a matrix. This is how it is supposed to work:

```
sage: (QQ^3).span([(1,2,3)]).basis()
[
(1, 2, 3)
]
sage: _.universe()
Vector space of degree 3 and dimension 1 over Rational Field
Basis matrix:
