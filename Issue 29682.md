I think we should have a cleaner way to add "tags" to packages, but in lieu of general solution this gets the job done.

The nonfree-dependencies thing is a bit of a legal mess. Users who install such a package lose the right to distribute their copy of sage. Entities such as universities may not want to wade into that sort of grey area. Anyway, that's orthogonal to this ticket.

Would

```
if any(not pkg.has_file(filename) for filename in filenames):
```
be more efficient than the current

```
if not all(pkg.has_file(filename) for filename in filenames):
```
and similarly a few lines later with `not any(...)`? Or does Python do this sort of optimization automatically?

I got confused and thought that the two might short-circuit at different points, but they will short-circuit at exactly the same point, so it makes no difference.

This is not your fault and should not be fixed on this ticket, but I wish that the code in `expand_class.py` were documented. Anyway, let's move forward with this.
