# Issue 32603: Fix unpickle_global when register_unpickle_override appears in a module not loaded at startup

Calls of `register_unpickle_override` appear in various parts of the Sage library.

As we are modularizing the library -- and delaying the import of some modules -- we need to make sure that `register_unpickle_override` calls that appear in late-imported modules are respected.
