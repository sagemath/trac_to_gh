A few points:

(1) There are a few typos in the doc ("choose choose", and "if given a list" reads better than "if inputted a list").

(2) The use of factor=1/max(seq.values()) means that the code can run forever if the maximum weight is a Python integer > 1, because then factor becomes 0.


```

sage: choice({1:int(2)})
[forever..]

```


(3) I don't know if it matters, but the while True approach can be quite inefficient for large arrays, because the odds of succeeding on any given try can be pretty low:


```
sage: d = dict((i,1) for i in range(10**4))
sage: time z = choice(d)
CPU times: user 0.14 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.14 s
Wall time: 0.15 s

sage: time z = choice(range(10**4))
CPU times: user 0.00 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.00 s
Wall time: 0.00 s
```

Until the previous comments are addressed/answered... `:-)`

Oh, and it would be nice to keep the lines to less than 80 characters !
