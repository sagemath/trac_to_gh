Trying to compute a Gröbner fan over a ring in which one variable name contains the other as a prefix gives the following error:


```
sage: P = PolynomialRing(QQ,3*5,"x"); x = P.gens(); M = Matrix(3,x)
sage: M
[ x0  x1  x2  x3  x4]
[ x5  x6  x7  x8  x9]
[x10 x11 x12 x13 x14]
sage: I = P.ideal(M.minors(2))
sage: I.groebner_fan()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
RuntimeError                              Traceback (most recent call last)
...
RuntimeError: Ring variables cannot contain each other as prefixes 
```
