Keywords: rubiks spkg gcc

Since bug #11168 (rubiks fails doctest with gcc 4.6.0 and -O2 optimisation) is fixed upstream by the gcc developers, we should apply the workaround only for gcc versions 4.6.0 and 4.6.1 (the latter to allow for pre-release versions of gcc 4.6.1), exactly like we did for Cliquer (#11227).
