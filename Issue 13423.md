# Issue 13423: implement xgcd for padics

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13627

Original creator: saraedum

Original creation time: 2012-10-19 15:04:06

Assignee: roed

Currently, there is no xgcd for padic numbers:

```
sage: R = Zp(3)
sage: R.one().xgcd(R.zero())
AttributeError: 'sage.rings.padics.padic_capped_relative_element.pAdicCappedRelativeElement' object has no attribute 'xgcd'
```


The attached patch implements it.

Hey Julian,

Some very minor formatting tweaks. LGTM otherwise, so if you're happy with my changes, you can set this positive review.

Thanks. I made a minor fix to one docstring. From my point of view, this can be `positive_review` now.

Julian, think you can rebase this so Volker can merge it in? Or do you want me to do it?

I don't have time to do so right now. Feel free to rebase it :)

Removing the pre-git dependency for scripting sanity.
