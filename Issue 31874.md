# Issue 31874: Unstable minimal polynomial for element of 2-adic Eisenstein Extension Field in pi defined by x^4 - 2*a

Keywords: minimal polynomial, padics

The following doctest in `src/sage/rings/padics/padic_generic_element.pyx` is unstable:


```
sage: K.<a> = QqCR(2^3,5)
sage: S.<x> = K[]
sage: L.<pi> = K.extension(x^4 - 2*a)
...
sage: elt = L.random_element() 
sage: P = elt.minimal_polynomial()
sage: P(elt) == 0
True
```


Sometimes it's not exact, ok the ring is not exact.
However, sometimes we get an error:

```
ArithmeticError: vector is not in free module
```

and from the documentation it is not clear when and why this happens.
