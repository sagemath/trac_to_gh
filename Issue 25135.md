I as asked to prepare a build of this that can be dropped into an installation of the Windows version of Sage.

In order to do this it's best to add DESTDIR support to the build so that it's easy to generate a file manifest (also, being an experimental package, it's even more important that uninstall work for it as well).

It seems this isn't handling installation of the Python module properly.

This appears to do the trick.  

Note, the renaming of the patch files to be ordered is not strictly necessary for this ticket, but it was done in anticipation of a follow-up ticket I'll be adding.
