# Issue 11297: Better documentation of comment/uncomment in notebook

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: kcrisman

Currently, NB help says

```
Highlight text and press ctrl-. to comment it and ctrl-, to uncomment it. Alternatively, use ctrl-3 and ctrl-4.
```

But it doesn't say WHEN each of these works.  For instance, the latter is the only one that works on Safari, apparently.

This has been fixed upstream and will presumably be in the next notebook update #16911.  See [this commit](https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/commit/12fe016af4dda6cfeaddeab5fa78154969648e6f).

Apparently #16911 is now merged, so here we go.
