Try typing each of these alone on a line, and you'll agree we have a problem:

```
   %maxima
   %gap
   %gp
   %pari
   %singular
   %lisp
```
   

The relevant code is this in `misc/sage_extension.py`:

```
    def register_interface_magics(self):
        """Register magics for each of the Sage interfaces"""
        from sage.misc.superseded import deprecation
        interfaces = [(name, obj)
                      for name, obj in sage.interfaces.all.__dict__.items()
                      if isinstance(obj, sage.interfaces.interface.Interface)]

        for real_name, obj in interfaces:
            def tmp(line, name=real_name):
                self.shell.run_cell('%s.interact()' % name)
```
