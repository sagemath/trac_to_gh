It is intended: *the field of real number is the field of real number* (see e.g. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number)). The code provided in the branch `u/vdelecroix/24456` is new, so it never used to support anything.

No. `create_RealField` is a convenience to handle options for the completion functor. There is no reason to use it directly.

The `real_field.RealField` in this branch has (almost) nothing to do with `real_mpfr.RealField`.

I don't quite understand the purpose of this new `RealField`. Maybe it would be good to elaborate on that.

Why? As I said above, I don't see why this should be a `Parent` in the first place.

Also, it would be good to replace the `coerce_map_from` method by a real [PEP 3119](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3119/) check like

```
sage: R = RealField()  # abstract real numbers
sage: issubclass(RR, R)
True
```

Is that in line with what you have in mind?

This is the kind of purposes I want this class for. `RealField()` should know about all ways of modelling concretely real numbers in Sage (but how?) and it should be possible to query it about real number questions, like the example you mentioned (but how?). The main problem I have is how to handle the distinction between exact subrings (e.g. QQ) versus approximations (e.g. RDF).

Note that in your example we might also want to make the following works

```
sage: import numbers
sage: isinstance(RR.element_class, numbers.Real)
```

This already works except for the fact that `RR` doesn't have an `element_class` attribute:

```
sage: import numbers
sage: isinstance(RR.an_element(), numbers.Real)
True
```


But I'd really like it to work on the *parent* since it's the parent which models the real numbers. Also, the coercion framework mostly works with parents, so this could be useful there too.

It would be nice if this could serve as the base field for real manifolds. 
For the moment we have:

```
sage: M = Manifold(3, 'M', field='real'); M
3-dimensional differentiable manifold M
sage: M.base_field()
Real Field with 53 bits of precision
sage: M.base_field() is RR
True
```

which is a bit awkward, since all subsequent calculus on `M` has nothing to do with `RR`. Actually `RR` is used as a proxy for the field of real numbers, so it would be very nice to replace it by something closer to the actual field of real numbers, as the new `RealField` proposed here (as far as I understand).

Sorry for being mute, i did not have time to write something when i put this ticket back on needs-review, but i did not want it to be merged that way. Blitzkrieg is not the way, there have been too much projects within Sage dying because of a lack of consensus, and i do not want the idea of a "genuine" real field to end like this.

Of course i am in favor of having such an abstraction and i am happy that some people support this as well, however when i promoted such an idea in various sage days, tutorials, discussions, tickets, it was clear from that experience that there was no consensus about that question, at all.

Hence, i think that a collectively approved decision on such subject should happen before code. For example, the proposed branch implies behaviors such as (random undocumented examples):


```
sage: R = QQ.completion(infinity, infinity) ; R
Real Field

sage: QQbar(sqrt(2)).parent()
Algebraic Field
sage: R(QQbar(sqrt(2))).parent()
Algebraic Real Field

sage: QQbar(sqrt(1)).parent()
Algebraic Field
sage: R(QQbar(sqrt(1))).parent()
Rational Field

sage: 0.1 in R
False

sage: R(RDF(0.1))
1/10

sage: R(pi)
ValueError: Can't coerce `pi` in any parent `Real Field` is a facade for

sage: R(ZZ(1)).parent()
Rational Field
```


Which behavior do we want for this ? Which interplay with existing representations of real numbers ? What are the implications in the whole Sage ? How do we ensure a smooth transition from the current ill-named `RR` and a genuine `RR` corresponding to the field of real numbers ? Since real numbers are everywhere, we should think about the consequences before being tied with wrong design and the imperative of backward compatibility.

All this to say that we need to have a plan with a boarder view, on which the community agrees.

Note that Ralf opened a ticket on that subject, and since ticket #17713 already has some debates on this subject and a similar purpose, let me suggest to continue the discussion there (so that we collect every input in a single place), and make it a task with appropriate subtickets once we reach a consensus.

This is because `AA(QQbar(sqrt(2)))` is the first to succeed (`QQ(QQbar(sqrt(2)))` does not).

This is because `QQ(QQbar(sqrt(1)))` does succeed.

As it should be!

Because `QQ(RDF(0.1))` works that way.

Because there is not yet any subset of the real numbers handling pi. As soon as there is one, it should be added to the facades and the above will work.

This is because `QQ(ZZ(1))` is the first to succeed (we might add `ZZ` to the list of facades).

For me, the current behavior of element construction is close to what it should be. To make things smoother, we might want to modify the `QQbar -> QQ` to a `QQbar -> AA`. This can be achieved by using a friend complex field on which we could call `.real()`. More precisely

```
def _element_constructor_(self, x):
    if parent(x) in self.facade_for():
        return x

    CC = ComplexField()   # the genuine one of course
    try:
        z = CC(x)
    except (ValueError,TypeError):
        pass
    else:
        if z.is_real():   # does not currently work for QQbar
            return z.real()

    raise ValueError("x not recognized as a real number")
```


> Which interplay with existing representations of real numbers?

This is precisely the question in [comment:23] that you are not helping with by asking it again.

> What are the implications in the whole Sage?

Just new features. To be able to do

- mathematical construction relying on an (abstract) field of real numbers (such as manifolds, see [comment:27])
- querries like "is parent X is a model for real numbers" (see [comment:22] and follow-up)

> How do we ensure a smooth transition from the current ill-named `RR` and a genuine `RR` corresponding to the field of real numbers?

This question is beyond the scope of this ticket. But see #24457.

For me `RealField` means the field of real numbers in the mathematical sense together with its exact operations `+`, `-`, `log`, `exp`, etc. Floating-point numbers do not respect exactness of operations and for me do not qualify as being real numbers. I agree that you can think of a floating point number in two ways. As an approximation of a real number "m ± 2<sup>-e</sup>" or as a diadic number "p 2<sup>-n</sup>". The latter is the actual datastructure but it is mostly useless to think of it this way when doing mathematics. This is moreover how it works in Sage: `QQ` coerces into `RealField(prec)` and not the contrary even though `RealField(prec)` is formally a subset of `QQ`.

OK, so what would it mean for a Python object (representing the real field) to "contain a class factory"? Do you want something like

```
sage: R = RealField()
sage: R.create(prec=53, implementation="mpfr")
Real Floating-point field with 53 bits of precision
```

or maybe

```
sage: R = RealField()
sage: R(prec=53, implementation="mpfr")
Real Floating-point field with 53 bits of precision
```

I do agree that it makes sense to differentiate between exact real fields and approximate real fields, but both are real fields.

Indeed!

> For technical reasons, the operations are not exact. But that is an implementation detail and not a mathematical property. For practical purposes, it behaves as a field.

It is not associative! Equality dramatically fails! This is not a **detail**.

I also agree and IMHO, for consistency with `numbers.Real`, the genuine `RealField` should be both used for approximate (= projection) and exact (= subset). And this should be very clearly stated.

Indeed, it was a terrible design from the start. The main obstruction to change it is backward compatibility... You can work on any of #24483, #24489 and #24457 that are prerequisite for this ticket.
