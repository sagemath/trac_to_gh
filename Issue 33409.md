# Issue 33409: face_iter/face_generator of polyhedra: Allow to specify algorithm instead of dual=False/True

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33646

In addition we add a function alias: `face_generator` for `CombinatorialPolyhedron` to make it consistent with `Polyhedron_base`.

LGTM.

I would suggest indicating in the docstring that algorithm option dominates dual if both are provided.

And perhaps moving `algorithm=` before `dual=`, as the latter will be deprecated.

I deprecated `dual` keyword altogether. If we are going to deprecate it, we might as well do it here.

Patchbot failure is unrelated to this ticket.
