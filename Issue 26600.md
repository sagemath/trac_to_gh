This change doesn't quite work:

```diff
-                self._points = sorted(points)
-                if self._points == list(range(len(points))) and all(isinstance(x,(int,Integer)) for x in self._points):
+                # if points are tuple, sort None before int types and str after int types
+                sortkey = lambda e: [(0 if x is None else 2 if isinstance(x, str) else 1, x) for x in e]\
+                    if isinstance(e, tuple) else e
+                self._points = sorted(points, key=sortkey)
```

See #26938.
