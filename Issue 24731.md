Keywords: structure coerce

Though small, the fix to `richcmp` is significant and fixes a lot of bugs.

I don't like this change. It will make it _harder_ to port Sage to Python 3 by hiding errors in an `try`/`except` block.

It would be much better to just not compare types in the first place.

Changing component from python3 to coercion.

If you say so--does this actually break anything?

FWIW I have personally written code before that implements comparisons between metaclasses (!).  I don't understand the implications when it comes to Sage though.

Looks like the comparison between two objects' types dates as far back to [f112feb0](https://github.com/sagemath/sagetrac-mirror/blob/master/src/sage/structure/element.pyx?id=f112feb091eca0caffc4892daf8d37c1f7781b01#n333).  It's probably not relevant.  Theoretically it _could_ be useful, but probably not for any currently existing code.

It seems to work on the patchbot. Erik, if you agree, you can set this to positive review.
