Follow-up from #29038.

By moving variables to sage_conf, they become available in the `sage.all` module even when invoked outside of a sage-env.

Do we still need


```
var('SAGE_NAUTY_BINS_PREFIX',        '')
```


in `src/sage/env.py` after this?

Yes, this is what makes the variable available in the module `sage.env`.

Oh, I see. Updated question: is there any reason to be going through sage.env still, as opposed to importing the value directly from `sage_conf`? Something to do with distro packaging?

(I've probably asked this same question three times by now, sorry.)

Well, sage_conf is still "optional". It's yet to be seen what distribution packagers will be doing with it. For now it's best to keep the logic of handling the situation when sage_conf does not exist centrally, rather than in every place that needs a variable.

Ok, my curiosity is satisfied. Needs review, or still working on it?
