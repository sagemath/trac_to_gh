This may be already known and there may be no way to avoid it, but having non operative methods as an option in tab completion may be confusing to some new users. This is a example that I ran across playing around with Sage today. 
 

```
sage: P.<x>  = PolynomialRing(GF(2), 'x')
sage: C = CyclicCode(3,g)
sage: C.addition_table()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
