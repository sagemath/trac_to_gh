# Issue 11183: Tab completion leading to non existent method in CyclicCode (addition_table)

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Keywords: tab completion, CyclicCode, addition_table, LinearCode, AttributeError

This may be already known and there may be no way to avoid it, but having non operative methods as an option in tab completion may be confusing to some new users. This is a example that I ran across playing around with Sage today. 
 


```
sage: P.<x>  = PolynomialRing(GF(2), 'x')
sage: C = CyclicCode(3,g)
sage: C.addition_table()
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

/home/ayeq/sage/<ipython console> in <module>()

/home/ayeq/sage/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/structure/parent.so in sage.structure.parent.Parent.__getattr__ (sage/structure/parent.c:5618)()

/home/ayeq/sage/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/sage/structure/parent.so in sage.structure.parent.raise_attribute_error (sage/structure/parent.c:2663)()

AttributeError: 'LinearCode' object has no attribute 'addition_table'
```
