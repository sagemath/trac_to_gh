# Issue 15826: Unify the classes RealSet and UnionOfIntervals

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Keywords: real intervals

The following two classes were introduced almost simultaneously:
- `sage.sets.real_set.RealSet` in #13125, which implements finite unions of open/closed/semi-closed intervals;
- `sage.schemes.elliptic_curves.height.UnionOfIntervals` in #8828, which has a more restricted scope (only unions of closed intervals).
It would be reasonable if these two classes were merged, and if all the functionality of `UnionOfIntervals` that is not yet in `RealSet` were moved there (e.g. scaling, computing the endpoints/boundary).

Volker: Would you have a moment to take a look whether I'm on the right track here. 
I'm wondering why the normalization of the init arguments of `InternalRealInterval` are not done by a method `InternalRealInterval.__classcall__` but rather by `RealSet._prep`. Because of this I have to duplicate some of this normalization in `InternalRealInterval.__mul__`.

Looking briefly at the code, `UnionOfIntervals` is somewhat more specialized, and so it is likely is faster than the more generic (and [indirectly] in the global namespace) `InternalRealInterval`. I'm not convinced that we should remove `UnionOfIntervals` unless there is not a speed regression (or it is minor).

However, I am +1 for unifying the behavior of these two classes. If you feel that you are having to duplicate some of the normalization code, then it might be better to try and refactor it because of the new use-case you have.

+1 The UnionOfIntervals was written for one specific application where timing is very important.

Do you have a benchmark that I can run without having to know anything about your application?

I think this is needed, it looks fine, and a patchbot is green.
