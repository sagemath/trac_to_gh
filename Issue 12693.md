Obviously, this can never have worked, as the `LinboxError` constructor was (implicitly) called with no arguments (hence `msg` defaulting to `0` rather than `""`):


```c++
// util/error.h

...
class LinboxError {
	const static size_t max_error_string = 256;
public:
	LinboxError (const char* msg = 0) {
		std::strncpy(strg, msg, max_error_string);
		strg[max_error_string-1] = 0;
	};
...
```



```c++
// util/debug.h

...
	class PreconditionFailed : public LinboxError
	{
		static std::ostream *_errorStream;

	    public:
		PreconditionFailed (const char *function, int line, const char *check) {
			if (_errorStream == (std::ostream *) 0)
				_errorStream = &std::cerr;

			(*_errorStream) << std::endl << std::endl;
			(*_errorStream) << "ERROR (" << function << ":" << line << "): ";
			(*_errorStream) << "Precondition not met:" << check << std::endl;
		}
...
```





From LinBox 1.1.7:

```c++
...
class LinboxError {
        static const size_t max_error_string = 256;
public:
        LinboxError (const char* msg = '\0') {
                std::strncpy(strg, msg, max_error_string);
                strg[max_error_string-1] = 0;
        };
...
```

FWIW, the latest development release, LinBox 1.2.2, still has this !**!** in it.

I'll probably add a proper fix to my LinBox 1.1.6 spkg at #12762.

Unhandled SIGABRT: An abort() occurred in Sage.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* component of Sage has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off(). You might
want to run Sage under gdb with 'sage -gdb' to debug this.
Sage will now terminate.

Certainly the Sage library has to get fixed as well.

So there are actually *three* things to fix:

* The `LinboxError` constructor (and/or the `Linbox::PreconditionFailed` constructor).

* The modulus has to be checked before calling LinBox, and modulus 1 has to be trivially(?) treated differently, as all of

```
sage: v=vector([Zmod(1)(1)]); m=matrix(Zmod(1),[[1]])
sage: v*m
sage: m*v
sage: m*m
```

   currently fail (while they worked in Sage 4.7.2).

* According to you, the coercion is wrong and should not happen at all. 

  (I never really understood the rationale of Sage's coercion model, as from the perspective of programming languages or type theory, any coercion -- as an implicit, automatic type conversion or cast -- should be a type **pro**motion.  And I have no idea how it comes to the ring of integers modulo 1.)

I can fix the first issue (e.g. at #12762); the others, especially the last one, have to get fixed by someone else.

Should we then add according doctests [here]?


Don't know whether what David mentioned is also properly addressed.

Not obsolete... On sage-6.6.beta1 I got it possible again

```
sage: vector(1/1) * matrix(Zmod(2),[[1]])
(1)
```

Something has changed in the coercion model and I opened #17859 for that (see also [This is the Trac macro *comment:11* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#comment:11-macro) which already pointed out the issue).

I propose to move this ticket to fixed since it is ok with Linbox.
