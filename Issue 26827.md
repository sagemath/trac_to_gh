This used to work prior to #19171


```
sage: R.<t> = GF(5)[]
sage: K = R.fraction_field()
sage: A.<x> = K[]
sage: x.divides(x)
True
```


Now it gives

This is failing because the fraction field has no `.divides()` method.

I guess the solution is to add a trivial `.divides()` method to fields? I am not sure why there is no such method already.

Two solutions (seem to) work:
- Either add a trivial `divides` method to the `ElementMethods` of the category `Fields`;
- Make `FpTElement` inherits from `FieldElement` rather than `RingElement`. 

Actually, I do not know why this class `FpTElement` inherits from `RingElement` rather than `FieldElement`. It would even make more sense for it to inherit from `FractionFieldElement` I would say.

`FractionFieldElement` is a Python class, I don't think it can inherit from it.

But I tested your second solution and it works. I'm preparing the commit.
