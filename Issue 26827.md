Keywords: polynomials division

This used to work prior to #19171


```
sage: R.<t> = GF(5)[]
sage: K = R.fraction_field()
sage: A.<x> = K[]
sage: x.divides(x)
True
```


Now it gives

This is failing because the fraction field has no `.divides()` method.

I guess the solution is to add a trivial `.divides()` method to fields? I am not sure why there is no such method already.

Changing type from PLEASE CHANGE to defect.

Changing component from PLEASE CHANGE to basic arithmetic.

Retarging tickets optimistically to the next milestone.  If you are responsible for this ticket (either its reporter or owner) and don't believe you are likely to complete this ticket before the next release (8.7) please retarget this ticket's milestone to sage-pending or sage-wishlist.

Two solutions (seem to) work:
- Either add a trivial `divides` method to the `ElementMethods` of the category `Fields`;
- Make `FpTElement` inherits from `FieldElement` rather than `RingElement`. 

Actually, I do not know why this class `FpTElement` inherits from `RingElement` rather than `FieldElement`. It would even make more sense for it to inherit from `FractionFieldElement` I would say.

`FractionFieldElement` is a Python class, I don't think it can inherit from it.

But I tested your second solution and it works. I'm preparing the commit.

Fine for me if it passes doctests.

All doctests (`--all --long`) pass for me.
