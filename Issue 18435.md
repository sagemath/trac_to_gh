The method `hecke_eigenvalue_field` of Newform objects is supposed to return the number field *generated* by the Hecke eigenvalues. If f is a newform and chi a Dirichlet character, the Hecke eigenvalue field of the twist f x chi is a subfield of the composite of the coefficient field of f and the field of values of chi; it needn't be the whole composite field.

The current implementation of twisting by newforms (introduced at #18086) does not check this; it computes some ambient field containing the Hecke eigenvalues and returns this, even though it can be much too large:

```
sage: f = Newforms(11)[0]
sage: chi = DirichletGroup(5, QQbar).0
sage: g = f.twist(chi)
sage: g
q - 2*I*q^2 + I*q^3 - 2*q^4 + O(q^6)
sage: g.hecke_eigenvalue_field()
Algebraic Field
```
