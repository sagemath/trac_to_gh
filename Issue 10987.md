Keywords: symbolics matrix

The symbolic ring (SR) in sage is considered a field:

```
  sage: SR.is_field()
  True
```
but it is not considered an integer domain:

```
  sage: SR.is_integer_domain()
  NotImplementedError                       Traceback (most recent call last)

NotImplementedError:
```
However, functions like matrix's **solve_right()** (correctly) test for the ring being integral domain before testing for the ring being a field. Thus, matrices with symbolic entries fail with an exception when trying to use **solve_right()** and related functions.

This behavior was introduced by ticket #10481 where they (correctly) changed the behavior of **is_integral_domain() **of a ring to raise an exception instead of returning it.

The problems is that **SR** does not override **is_integral_domain() **correctly. I propose the addition of the following function to sage/symbolic/rings.pyx

```python
    def is_integral_domain(self, proof = True):
        """
        Returns True, since the symbolic expression ring is reported as a
        field.
        
        EXAMPLES::
        
            sage: SR.is_integral_domain()
            True
        """
        return True
```

What do you think?

I have little doubt it still is. I suspect that one should just be pragmatic with SR and just keep fingers crossed when trying computations with SR. If they succeed: great! The answer might even be correct. If not: formulate the problem in another way.

Hi!

Why not adding a subset of symbolic Ring which forms a Field?
I think a good choice would be the subset of all symbolic functions which are
meromorphic. 

The Meromorph functions form a field, and contain most of the symbolic functions in use. Additionally this could be handy if we want to introduce differential algebras for symbolic integration and differentiation.

Hello,

I really do not like the strategy. Starting to have special cases for the symbolic ring will be a nightmare to write and maintain. The symbolic ring is definitely an ugly (and very useful) piece of code but it should not be intrusive. Not speaking about the fact that a line like `from sage.symbolic.ring import SymbolicRing` takes time to be executed. The current situtation that makes SR thinks that it is a field looks much more natural to me: keep the bullshit in one place.

And do you really think that we should support elliptic curves over the symbolic ring? I saw that there is an example in the doc, but we could just ignore it. From my perspective, `SR` should not even be a ring.

Could you give more motivation of changing the current situation? I do not get it from the ticket description?

Vincent

I agree that my patch has to be improved.  However, I think that this can be done without globally pretending that the symbolic ring is a field.
