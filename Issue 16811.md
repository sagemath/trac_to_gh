2) Work directly on the Hasse Diagram. Build the random Poset on n elements from a poset on n-1 elements:

Consider all minimal elements `m_1,...m_c` of the previous digraph and add the edges `m_i,n` with probability `p`. If some edge `m_i` was not added, consider the immediate predecessors of `m_i` and do the same with them.

This second way to build them benefits from the transitivity of posets.

It seems that it is only there to provide random posets for computer tests, with no specific property in mind."

I add this on wishlist-milestone, so that I don't forget it totally. I'm not going to code this at least for release 6.4.

Maybe we could also generate random posets with given restrictions? For example


```
# Graded poset

# set_random_seed(0)
from sage.misc.prandom import random
from sage.misc.randstate import current_randstate
dice=current_randstate()

n=20
prob=0.2
# Too many 1-element levels... make better.
levels=Partitions(n).random_element()
p=Permutations(len(levels)).random_element()
levels=[levels[x-1] for x in p]

# Poset P will have 0..levels[0] as minimal element,
# levels[0]..levels[1]-1 covering them and so on.
G=DiGraph({x:[] for x in range(0,n)})
prev_start=0
prev_end=levels[0]

for i in levels[1:]:
    # Connect every element of previous level to some element on this level
    for prev in range(prev_start, prev_end):
        r=randint(prev_end, prev_end+i-1)
        G.add_edge(prev, r)
    # Connect every element of this level to some element on previous level
    for e in range(prev_end, prev_end+i):
        if G.in_degree(e) == 0:
            r=randint(prev_start, prev_end-1)
            G.add_edge(r, e)
    # And now the random part
    for e1 in range(prev_start, prev_end):
        for e2 in range(prev_end, prev_end+i):
            if dice.c_rand_double() < prob:
                G.add_edge(e1, e2)
    prev_start=prev_end
    prev_end=prev_end+i
P=Poset(G);
```


Calling this kind of functions could be something like `Posets.RandomPoset(20, 0.2, properties=['graded', 'connected', 'third_property'])`.

This could be made still faster: just generate a random number of edges to add, instead of looping. However, this patch at least makes this five times faster.

Replying to [comment:6 chapoton]:

True. I removed it.

...and now realized that `shuffle` **is** as a Sage function, so it takes use of `set_random_seed()` and could be used (So, what I was thinking??). But maybe it makes no real difference anyways, as it is much faster than creating the poset.
