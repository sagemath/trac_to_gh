2/3 patchbots are able to reproduce it

    https://patchbot.sagemath.org/ticket/0/

may be related to the fact that coxeter3 is present... I don't know.

Note that the failure is order dependent because of `UniqueRepresentation` that thinks that Sage Integer 1 is the same as Python int 1.

```
sage: from sage.combinat.interval_posets import TamariIntervalPosets_size
sage: T1 = TamariIntervalPosets_size(1)
sage: T2 = TamariIntervalPosets_size(1r)
sage: print (parent(T1._size), parent(T2._size))
(Integer Ring, Integer Ring)
```

vs

```
sage: from sage.combinat.interval_posets import TamariIntervalPosets_size
sage: T2 = TamariIntervalPosets_size(1r)
sage: T1 = TamariIntervalPosets_size(1)
sage: print (parent(T1._size), parent(T2._size))
