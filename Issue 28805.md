This is going to be quite fragile, because now you're encoding a rather arbitrary dictionary order into the doctests, where no order matters (in py3 it's probably insertion order; a change in code somewhere that changes insertion order would break tests again!).

Why not introduce a little utility function `print_dict_sorted` that recovers the sorted dictionaries? It would amount to

```
sorted( D.items(), key=lambda t:t[0])
```

but with an appropriate routine you could print the result in a more dict-compatible way so that you can fix each doctest with a single-line edit.

That way you end up with a more future-proof fix, and it makes total sense to insert such a print routine at least into the doctest namespace (but then almost by necessity also in the interactive namespace)

Thanks for the suggestion! The routine I was thinking about already exists!.

True, but that would cause a deviation between doctest output and the output that the actual example in the command line would give. The `IPython` reason for dispensing with sorting dictionaries is a good one, so I would not be in favour of bringing back that hook in general.

This deviation already exists, as the IPython sorting of dicts is only active during doctests. That said though, I do not have a strong preference for either solution – though I agree it is generally desirable to keep doctest output as close as possible to the actual output.

It seems pretty_print aims at a different target: its default is latex output in the command line (that's a bad default), and in general "this function chooses the highest-quality output supported by the user interface", so that doesn't quite hit the goals of doctests (which should be concise and human-readable).

If we do

```
dm = get_display_manager()
dm.preferences.text='plain'
```

we end up with better results for our doctesting purposes. But that would be worse than `from pprint import pprint`.

I agree that generally doctests should be focussed on testing very specific things rather than entire dictionaries. Rewriting all these doctests case-by-case so that dictionaries are not printed anymore seems like a huge task though.

As the current patch also seems to fail with 32-bit, it still seems to me that the simplest approach to move forward with this is to extend `pretty_print` by a sort keyword. A first step for this is #29136, needing review, which stops `pretty_print` from outputting latex on the command line.

For reference, this problem was discussed in this [thread on devel](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/fXrv4JC6NEI/LwIcVb5EEwAJ) and there does not seem to be much disagreement about this.

It is a quite economical way to do things. But we have to document somewhere how dictionaries have to tested going forward. As far as I can see people still want or keep testing full dictionaries. Which leaves two options
* `sorted` if we are sure it does the job in every case
* since we are typing the whole dictionary anyway, create a `expected_dict` populated with expected value and compare it to the result dictionary we get. I would hope dictionary comparison doesn't care about sorting.

I am looking at some stuff in .rst file. It is both doctests and documentation. For example in `doc/en/prep/Advanced-2DPlotting.rst`

```
Here are the options for contour plots.

- They are given as an "attribute" \- no parentheses \- of the
  ``contour_plot`` object.

- They are given as a dictionary (see :ref:`the programming tutorial
  <Advanced>`).

::

    sage: contour_plot.options
    {'aspect_ratio': 1,
     'axes': False,
     'colorbar': False,
     'contours': None,
     'fill': True,
     'frame': True,
     'labels': False,
     'legend_label': None,
     'linestyles': None,
     'linewidths': None,
     'plot_points': 100,
     'region': None}
```

If we use `sorted` we have to make a note about it in the documentation that it is just to make presentation consistent. If we just reproduce the output, the order may change unexpectedly.

We are talking about only putting `random` in specific documentation where it doesn't matter and ordering would look weird. But even there I would agree on getting as specific as possible to avoid having to do it. For example, in the same file as comment:28 and after it we have

```

sage: contour_plot.options

 'axes': False,
 'colorbar': False,

 'frame': True,
 'labels': False,
 'legend_label': None,
 'linestyles': None,
 'linewidths': None,
 'plot_points': 100,
 'region': None}
```

Where we could look specifically at the concerned dictionary element. But the one in comment:28 is part of an exposition of a feature. It feels ridicule to compare the output or to to artificially order it as opposed to just mentioning that the elements are not always in that order.

We have to use some common sense on what is appropriate and what isn't.

If you have

```
sage: foo  # random
2 + 2
```

this also will pass even if `foo` is a `dict` or `'fish'` (i.e. I can make `2 + 2 = 'fish'`).

I guess in this case because it is meant to be for an illustrative purpose that it is fine for a `# random` with an explanation.

I have not as much time to deal with this as I thought. If someone wants to take over or go back to arojas' branch, it is fine by me.

Also, I don't see the need to give a final solution to this *now*. We could just merge my patch to unblock the ipython upgrade, and keep this open to implement a different solution when someone has time/willingness to work on it.

EDIT: Actually, I forgot about 32-bit, so it seems the patch can't be merged as-is anyway

Maybe removing the sorting of dictionaries isn't necessary. We can just overwrite the pretty print function during testing:

No, I didn't upgrade and it worked for me.

The function `_sorted_for_pprint` that it uses requires iPython at least 5:

https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/5.x/IPython/lib/pretty.py

If that is a problem or if this is ever removed, we can just copy paste this tiny function.

The function `for_type` has been in their since IPython version 1. So I hope that it is somewhat stable.
