# Issue 27668: Bug in showing the substitution of a variable with a custom "latex_name" in a multivariate polynomial

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27905

Original creator: @Miguel-OYeah

Original creation time: 2019-05-31 14:48:01

Sage version:
SageMath version 8.7, Release Date: 2019-03-23

Minimal reproducible example:

```python
%typeset_mode True
var("k1,k2,k3,k4,a1,b1,c1,d1") # Let's define some parameters
R.<p,q> = SR[] # Variables of the polynomial
poly= (c1*k1)*p*q + (c1*k2 + a1)*p + (c1*k3 + b1)*q + c1*k4 + d1 # Simple bilinear function in p and q
poly.subs(p=var("alpha")) # ---> Shows correct substitution
poly.subs(p=var("gamma",latex_name=r"\color{blue}{\gamma}", domain="real")) # ---> Shows incorrect substitution
# BUT
print(poly.subs(p=var("gamma",latex_name=r"\color{blue}{\gamma}", domain="real"))) # ---> Shows CORRECT substitution
```


It is a bug while showing the polynomial, but not while substituting because the print() shows the correct result.

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).
