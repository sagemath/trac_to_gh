Sage offers two interfaces to the [GMP-ECM](http://ecm.gforge.inria.fr/) library. One text based in Python `sage.interfaces.ecm` and one in Cython `sage.libs.libecm` that uses C function calls.

This ticket stands for replacing the text based interface by the Cython one. Also the code and documentation of `Integer.factor` should be adapted.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29207
