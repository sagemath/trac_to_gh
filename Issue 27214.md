I ran into a speed block using this basis recently and realized that the reason was the explicit formula in terms of the power sum was not implemented.  Speed tests to come.

The speedup is probably minor (but still significant) for symmetric functions of smaller degree, but major for larger degree.

For a smaller degree example:
with:

```
sage: time s(ht[3,2])
CPU times: user 96 ms, sys: 13.5 ms, total: 110 ms
Wall time: 101 ms
sage: time ht(s[3,2])

Wall time: 117 ms
```


without:

```
sage: time s(ht[3,2])

Wall time: 167 ms
sage: time ht(s[3,2])
CPU times: user 202 ms, sys: 35.3 ms, total: 238 ms

That is quite an improvement.

I have one recommendation, you should replace

```diff
-p.sum(c*elt for c,elt in foo)
+p.linear_combination((elt, c) for c,elt in foo)
```

as the latter has less transient elements because it does not compute the scalar multiplication on each element. At least, I expect some additional speedup by doing that.

Some nitpicks:

Add back in this period:

```diff
-        The coercions are set up between the ``other_basis``.
+        The coercions are set up between the ``other_basis``
```


I think this would make it a little easier to read the (non-compiled) doc:

```diff
-            \sum_{j=0}^r (-1)^{r-j}k^j\binom{r,j} \left(
-            \frac{1}{k} \sum_{d|k} \mu(d/k) p_d \right)_k.
+            \sum_{j=0}^r (-1)^{r-j}k^j\binom{r,j}
+            \left( \frac{1}{k} \sum_{d|k} \mu(d/k) p_d \right)_k.
```

Feel free to ignore this.

Missing comma:

```diff
-For a partition `\gamma = (1^{m_1}, 2^{m_2}, \ldots r^{m_r})`,
+For a partition `\gamma = (1^{m_1}, 2^{m_2}, \ldots, r^{m_r})`,
```


I don't know how mathjax handles the nonbreaking space `\right)_k~.`. You are also not doing it consistently between `_b_bar_power_k_r` and `_b_bar_power_gamma`.

I believe this looks better in the doc:

```diff
-\sum_{\gamma} \left< h_\lambda, p_\gamma \right>
+\sum_{\gamma} \left\langle h_\lambda, p_\gamma \right\rangle
```
