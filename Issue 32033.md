The De Rham cohomology is in fact an algebra. We change the category and class name.

This happens in view of #29581, where the set of characteristic cohomology classes constitutes a sub-algebra.

I decided to keep the class and representation name. It is very uncommon in literature to call it the "de Rham cohomology algebra".
