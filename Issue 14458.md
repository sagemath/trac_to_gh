It seems that the following doesn't work:

1. build `ecl`
2. move Sage tree
3. build `maxima`

This can be fixed by simply adding a symbolic link `local/lib/ecl/ecl` -> `local/include/ecl` such that ECL finds its `ecl/config.h`.

All I can say is that my fix solves the problem for me... but I admit I cannot really explain why ECL would look for its `config.h` file inside `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/ecl/ecl`.

Sure, but then the description of #11359 should be changed to reflect the deeper issue which still remains to be fixed. My spkg solves the problem described by #11359.
