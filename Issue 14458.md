# Issue 14458: Fix ECL relocation

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2013-05-30 10:48:07

Assignee: jdemeyer

It seems that the following doesn't work:

  1. build `ecl`
  2. move Sage tree
  3. build `maxima`

This can be fixed by simply adding a symbolic link `local/lib/ecl/ecl` -> `local/include/ecl` such that ECL finds its `ecl/config.h`.

The problem described in this ticket seems related to #11359. The comments there suggest problems a little deeper than the solution proposed here would address. Perhaps worth taking a look at?

See #11359 instead.

All I can say is that my fix solves the problem for me... but I admit I cannot really explain why ECL would look for its `config.h` file inside `$SAGE_LOCAL/lib/ecl/ecl`.

I would be in favor of putting the new spkg here and leaving #11359 open until somebody decides to investigate further.

Sure, but then the description of #11359 should be changed to reflect the deeper issue which still remains to be fixed. My spkg solves the problem described by #11359.
