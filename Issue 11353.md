SageTeX runs into a namespace conflict when naming the .tex file "sage.tex".

Minimal example:


```
$ emacs sage.tex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{sagetex}
\begin{document}
\begin{sageblock}
    f(x) = exp(x) * sin(2*x)
\end{sageblock}
\sageplot{plot(f, -1, 1)}
\end{document}

$ latex sage.tex
$ ls
sage.aux	sage.dvi	sage.log	sage.sage	sage.tex
```


now I run sage on sage.sage


```
$ sage sage.sage
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "sage.py", line 2, in <module>
    from sage.all_cmdline import *   # import sage library
  File "/sandbox/sage.py", line 2, in <module>
    from sage.all_cmdline import *   # import sage library
ImportError: No module named all_cmdline
$ ls
sage.aux	sage.log	sage.pyc	sage.tex
sage.dvi	sage.py		sage.sage
```


This creates a local file sage.py. Now we have a name space conflict with the sage package. A quick fix for this bug is to name .tex file somehow different, e.g. sage_test.tex.

I believe this has been fixed upstream.  For me the files created are `sage.sagetex.*` using `sagetex-2.3.3.p2` and Sage 5.0.  I don't remember exactly when this was changed.

If this is not fixed for you please include what versions of Sage and SageTeX.
