Most modules that import from `sage.misc.latex` only import the `latex` function, which does not actually need to run any program; so removing this module-level import removes the indirect dependency on `sage.misc.ostools` (and hence on CPython- and Unix-specific code).

> Most modules that import from `sage.misc.latex` only import the `latex` function, which does not actually need to run any program; so removing this module-level import removes the indirect dependency on `sage.misc.ostools` (and hence on CPython- and Unix-specific code). 

If we need to care of these dependency issues because of the modularization effort, it might be useful to have a patchbot plugin to watch out increase of dependency among sage modules.
