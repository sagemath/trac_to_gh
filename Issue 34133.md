Please get out of the habit of writing lines like this:

```
+In Sage, they are modeled in the :class:`SchubertPolynomial_class`. Instances of
+this class can be created by creating an instance ``X`` of a Schubert polynomial
+ring using the constructor :func:`SchubertPolynomialRing`. 
```

They are useless as you have the examples and are already at the code (and technical regarding implementation details).

`\\Bold{Z}` -> `\ZZ` (only one `\` as the string block is marked `r`).
