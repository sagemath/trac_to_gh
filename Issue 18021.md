Add several fix to matrix groups and matrix spaces:
- matrix space should not override the `__call__` of `Parent`
- matrix groups should by default define a coercion embedding to the associated matrix space
- use the method `_matrix_` to define a default conversion to matrix spaces

It would solve the two following issues

```
sage: G = SL(3,QQ)
sage: M = MatrixSpace(QQ,3)
sage: G.one() == M.identity_matrix()  # pb 1
False
sage: G.one() + M.identity_matrix()   # pb 2
... BOOM ...
```
