It's an upstream patch.
So I would happily positive review it.
I'll just let you argue why it's not documented in SPKG.txt first.

IMHO the patches should be documented in the patch, not in some other file. I did document it in the patch...

I kind of agree this would be better.

But as you can see, I just did it the old way as a "reviewer" commit as it was trivial.
