Arb seems slower than everything... though it does not hurt to have one more algorithm. Note that arb can cache the results internally (intended to be used for evaluation of special functions).

Replying to [comment:3 vdelecroix]:
> Arb seems slower than everything...

Really? I also did some crude benchmarks and `arb` seems pretty close to `flint`, certainly faster than `pari` or `bernmm`. I will do some finer benchmarks later today. And we should probably get rid of the `bernmm` algorithm since we have 3 faster implementations in Sage now.

I got these timings calling the C libraries directly. The differences are insignificant.


```
n            arb         flint       pari
100          5.19e-06    4.91e-06    6.65e-06
1000         0.00017     0.000182    0.000234
10000        0.0217      0.0218      0.0325
100000       4.931       5.848       5.706
1000000      547.378     574.585     623.222
```

`bernmm` is faster for n > 10<sup>5</sup>, approximately (it takes 4.96 s for n = 10<sup>5</sup>, and 279 s for n = 10<sup>6</sup>).
