Arb seems slower than everything... though it does not hurt to have one more algorithm. Note that arb can cache the results internally (intended to be used for evaluation of special functions).

> Arb seems slower than everything...

Really? I also did some crude benchmarks and `arb` seems pretty close to `flint`, certainly faster than `pari` or `bernmm`. I will do some finer benchmarks later today. And we should probably get rid of the `bernmm` algorithm since we have 3 faster implementations in Sage now.
