Keywords: preparse preparser runfile

If one execute the following script in Sage interpreter:

```
2 = 3
print (2)
```

one will get a exception

```
ValueError: The name "2" is not a valid Python identifier.
```

which is expected.

But if one execute it from a file with `sage file.sage` or in the interpreter with `%runfile file.sage`, one does not get an error and the script simply prints `3`.

This is due to the fact that Sage preparse the file before running it; if one looks into the generated `file.sage.py`, one can see that the integers are replaced by `_sage_const_nnn`, **even when the integer is on the left-hand-side of an equality**. As it is a valid python identifier, there is no error anymore and its value can be modified.
