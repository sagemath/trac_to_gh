As pointed out by William on [this](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-support/76aFrP1pxD4) `sage-support` thread. 

SAGE FAQ must be updated; here is what it looks like now:

 http://sagemath.org/doc/faq/index.html

And we should update *how* we host the faq.  Maybe put it in the sage source code?  Maybe move it to wiki.sagemath.org?  I don't know.

If I'm not mistaken, it is in the source already.

```
$ ls src/doc/en/faq
conf.py			faq-usage.rst		templates
faq-contribute.rst	index.rst
faq-general.rst		static
```

Or did I misunderstand this question?

Yes, and it even occasionally gets updated... :-) (see e.g. #15307)

Changing status from new to needs_info.

Hi, 

I am going to be unable to submit this (or any) patch for atleast two weeks from now as my Mac cannot connect to a non-wireless internet ATM. But, there are a couple of points that need to be discussed; please also point me to more up-to-date information and if possible, adding to pointers to potential addition would help me: 

1. It says the FAQ is maintained by Minh Van Nguyen. So, I am ccing him on this ticket and I hope he does not mind... 

2. Isn't the list which answers the question "Who uses Sage" definitely obsolete?

3. In the question about getting help, we should probably add http://ask.sagemath.org. I think it could be helpful if we could somehow get a Stack Exchange Site for Sage. But this might be easy or hard depending upon the initial momentum. I could try submitting an initial proposal on Area 51 but we need a huge lot of support in the beginning to get started. But once done, I think we can keep the momentum going... 

4. The answer to the question "How do I get started?" mentions sagenb.org. But I have been under the impression that support might be dropped for sagenb. Is this not so? Also, some subremarks/subquestions:

     - Should we mention http://cloud.sagemath.org here? (And, of course update the rest of the text...) 

     - Sage Cell Servers should be surely mentioned. 
 
     - The bit of the answer about Sage Notebook on a non-default browser is probably out of place and is slightly confusing (`opera` should be replaced by sth generic: `<browser-name>` or such).

5. The question about jsMath is obsolete and must be removed. 

6.  We should go through mailing list and get a list of things that people often ask or mistakenly assume and notice odd behaviour. Some that come to mind: 

- Polynomials vs Symbolic Expressions
- Writing a given integer in different basis. 
- IPython Terminal Colour and other stuff
- [etc...] 

7. The section "Contributing to Sage" needs to mention GIT, the new GIT Trac and probably some more questions that one has about developing with GIT. I have had a lot of these questions recently and could probably contribute a couple of questions here.

- This section could advertise an invitation for people to contribute doctests: see [#12891](http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12891) for where this is coming from. :-) 

OK, this is my preliminary set of observations. If there are more, please put them in a comment here...

Yes, and if not, it is likely to quickly become so...

+1.  We could write to sage-devel and ask people to vote for it.

> 4. The answer to the question "How do I get started?" mentions sagenb.org. But I have been under the impression that support might be dropped for sagenb. Is this not so? 

The website http://sagenb.org will cease to exist, though the timeframe is unclear. 

> Also, some subremarks/subquestions:
> 
>      - Should we mention http://cloud.sagemath.org here? (And, of course update the rest of the text...) 

Yes.   I bet a significant fraction of new people who use Sage use it through http://cloud.sagemath.org

Yes, totally obsolete.

It would also be better if people could easily add to the FAQ when they answer such questions.    The whole trac-based dev process is too cumbersome for quick FAQ entries.

I think continually trying to replicate what is (mostly already) answered elsewhere is doomed to fail (or to again become obsolete soon), so we should probably concentrate on very basic questions and answers [that aren't likely to change soon] (although a lot probably also belongs to the README) and just provide links to other resources (and specific answers).

Replying to [comment:7 leif]:

Is your last comment in reference to my point (6)? If so, do you mean that we should not have anything about common mistakes that people make when coming to Sage anew? For  example, the polynomial vs symbolic expression has appeared on sage-support quite often!

While I agree with you that we should not add stuff that we should not add things that would become obsolete quickly, I guess some of these points appear so often that it is probably worth having some standard answers to refer people to. Do you agree here?

Well, IMHO the main problem currently is that we have an unordered list of random topics.

I'd actually ask on sage-support etc. what users think should be answered / are the common problems and pitfalls (installing Sage / using Sage / using this and that).  (This could be done regularly, and we could also post an updated [short] FAQ monthly, say.)

There are also frequently general questions regarding the relationsship of Sage's Python and packages to system ones.  (Or in other words, a couple of specific questions arise because users don't know enough about how Sage is designed / structured.)

Any reason why this is not needs_review?


---

Comment by chapoton created at 2014-08-31 10:02:28

Well, I would say this is only a first step. But of course, it is better than doing nothing.

Comment by kcrisman created at 2014-12-15 19:15:27

Needs rebase - if I get time today I'll do it, even.  But see also #16628 and #17491 for possible further work.

Comment by kcrisman created at 2014-12-15 19:15:33

Changing status from needs_info to needs_work.

Comment by kcrisman created at 2014-12-15 20:25:34

Sorry for moving this off the public ticket, I wasn't sure how to do that right.  In any case I kept the author.

I'll momentarily take care of a few of these other issues on this ticket.

Comment by kcrisman created at 2014-12-15 21:03:01

Okay, this should be ready for review.  I'm happy with chapoton's changes, fwiw.

Yet to do: 
* Adding more actual frequently asked questions
* Organizing in a sane way
* updated developer info more

Hello guys !

I made a pass on this patch, and I do not have much to add. I actually changed the "How do I get started" section a bit, because:

1) The same instructions were repeated twice (sagecloud, sagenb, the binaries) and a sentence did not even end (a link toward the download page was missing)

2) It feels a bit weird to have the section "How do I get started" begin with an advertisement for the cloud. I did not remove anything, but only moved the Cloud+Sagenb+Sage cell into a list entitled "when you do not want to download anything".

Hoping that you will have no problem with this, I pused the changes to a new branch (and I updated the ticket). If you can review my commit, this branch can get it !

This is a doctest that attempts to launch a browser:

```
+You can also run it from the command line of sage::
+
+    sage: notebook()
```

Times out for me, though might also cause other undesirable behavior
