On going through the example in  the documentation of `UniformRandomUniform` method following error occurs.

```
sage: H = hypergraphs.UniformRandomUniform(52, 3, 17)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

    263         all_edges = Subsets(vertices, uniformity)
    264         try:
--> 265             edges = sample(all_edges, m)
    266         except OverflowError:
    267             raise OverflowError("binomial({}, {}) too large to be treated".format(n, k))

    179     """

    181
    182 def random():

/home/vipul/sage/local/lib/python3.7/random.py in sample(self, population, k)
    315             population = tuple(population)
    316         if not isinstance(population, _Sequence):
--> 317             raise TypeError("Population must be a sequence or set.  For dicts, use list(d).")

    319         n = len(population)

TypeError: Population must be a sequence or set.  For dicts, use list(d).
```

Above defect should be fixed as early as possible. As It is already in latest sage release.

P.S : It also passes doctest. So something is wrong there too.

Note that the testing framework did not catch this because Sage is using a verbatim copy of the Python 2 version of the `Random` module during doctesting. This is to ensure identical results between Python 2 and Python 3 in the doctests.

I have just done that, and fortunately there do not seem to be any other errors of this kind. Only two other files have doctests that lead to an error when using the Python 3 `Random` module, but in both cases this is because the tests implicitly depend on a specific "random" result from a previous doctest.
