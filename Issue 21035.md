Fixing `__normalize` should be pretty easy: laurent polynomials are represented as u*x<sup>n</sup>, where u is a unit or 0. Normalize should simply force `n` to be a particular value (probably `n=0`) if `u=0`.

A fairly random number.

Have you considered turning `__u` into a sparse polynomial, shifting it, and computing the hash from there? I guess that would be my only proposal here to remove a duplication of code. But it is probably not worth it. Your tests should catch any changes in the implementation of the hash function of polynomials…
