This was requested by a participant at the first Sage Education Day.  I'm putting this in notebook but I really can't think of any appropriate component.

This would not be terribly hard to do using the python wave module.  See this interact for a basic demo:

http://wiki.sagemath.org/interact/misc#Hearingatrigonometricidentity

It would be good to wrap this functionality in a more user-friendly command.

I meant to say about the scipy signal processing stuff, but then thought better about it.

I think this would fit well into a widget framework to represent objects in the notebook.

Nice! Wow, I wasn't expecting a reply from one of the core Jupyter developers ;-) though I guess he WAS one of the original people on this ticket :-)

Maybe this ticket can then just be adding this to a likely place in the documentation.
