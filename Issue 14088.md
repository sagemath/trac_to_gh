What exactly goes wrong?  Loading and saving stats is done in `DocTestController`, so there aren't multiple processes trying to write to the same file...

There could be when testing the doctester in parallel. Anyway I have a patch ready but it's on `sage.math` which is currently down.

Not always. Locking has different goals. Locks should be held as short as possible, which cannot be guaranteed (for example when writing the GAP workspace). My solution also solves the problem of exceptions/crashes during the write and it doesn't need any changes to the reading of files.

If you prefer `write_safely`, that's fine for me. However, I do think that using locking and using a temporary file are two different solutions which are sufficiently different to warrant different names. Given this, perhaps it is better to be explicit about the implementation.

Well if your goal is to eventually have both proper locking and atomic writing separately then thats fine. But the name should still convey why we are doing that, not how. 

Obviously many Sage developers are not familiar with which file system operations are atomic, so they will rightfully be confused when they see code that writes a cache with `write_via_temp`. Clearly there is an optimization where you take out that extra step ;-)

How about `atomic_write`?
