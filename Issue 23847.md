Keywords: ubuntu, ppa, repository, zesty, artful

When I updated to Ubuntu Artful Aardvark (17.10), I noticed that [SageMath](SageMath) was uninstalled.

After following the tutorial http://www.sagemath.org/download-linux.html, I was able to add the repository:


```
sudo -E apt-add-repository -y ppa:aims/sagemath
[sudo] password for rolandog: 
gpg: keybox '/tmp/tmpzk8nwevw/pubring.gpg' created
gpg: /tmp/tmpzk8nwevw/trustdb.gpg: trustdb created
gpg: key BDCB16CCBE796FF2: public key "Launchpad PPA for AIMS" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
OK
```


However, upon executing the update command:


```
sudo -E apt-get update
Err:18 http://ppa.launchpad.net/aims/sagemath/ubuntu artful Release            
  404  Not Found
Reading package lists... Done                      
N: Skipping acquire of configured file 'main/binary-i386/Packages' as repository 'http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb stable InRelease' doesn't support architecture 'i386'
E: The repository 'http://ppa.launchpad.net/aims/sagemath/ubuntu artful Release' does not have a Release file.
N: Updating from such a repository can't be done securely, and is therefore disabled by default.
N: See apt-secure(8) manpage for repository creation and user configuration details.
```


So, browsing the available dists, http://ppa.launchpad.net/aims/sagemath/ubuntu/dists/ I noticed they were quite out of date:

Upon visiting the AIMS https://launchpad.net/~aims launchpad landing page, sure enough, there is a notice that says:


```
AIMS-desktop is developed at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences - South Africa (http://www.aims.ac.za), a centre for education and research in Cape Town, South Africa, and the first centre in the AIMS network.

The AIMS desktop PPAs listed here are deprecated. AIMS desktop is moving from an Ubuntu derivative to a Debian derivative. We expect to launch shortly after Debian Stretch is becomes the next stable release in 2017.

Watch this space: https://desktop.aims.ac.za/

We hope to continue updating the Sagemath PPA for Ubuntu on a best-effort basis, but Sage is available in Debian stretch (December 2016), so will be in Ubuntu from 17.04, or you can (manually) install the binaries from http://www.sagemath.org/download.html
```


After browsing in the sage-devel mailing list, I found the following email https://groups.google.com/d/topic/sage-devel/NoyVpYdYRAM/discussion where it is mentioned that current packages are now located in https://packages.ubuntu.com/zesty/math/ ... but, upon browsing it can be seen that sagemath isn't listed in https://packages.ubuntu.com/artful/math/

So, I enabled the Zesty Universe packages, and was able to 'see' the sagemath package https://packages.ubuntu.com/zesty/math/sagemath in Synaptic

However, upon attempting installation, I receive the following error message in Synaptic. The title of the warning says 'Could not mark all packages for installation or upgrade'. Followed by this description 'The following packages have unresolvable dependencies. Make sure that all required repositories are added and enabled in the preferences.'

[sudo] password for rolandog:

Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 sagemath : Depends: libgsl2 but it is not installable
            Depends: libsingular4-dev (< 1:4.1) but 1:4.1.0-p3+ds-2 is to be installed
            Depends: python-cysignals-pari (>= 1.2.0+ds-2) but it is not going to be installed

            Recommends: sagetex but it is not going to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.
```


This is where I hit a wall and don't know where to proceed. I could manually force a lower version for the singular packages, but I already have the libgsl23 library installed, and this library is used by many other packages that are currently installed.


Any suggestions or workarounds?

Should this be reported elsewhere, like in GSL https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/ ?

Indeed the PPA is not maintained anymore since the AIMS, which maintained that, moved to Debian. 

However, Ubuntu 18.04 ships Sage directly, so let me suggest to upgrade to Ubuntu 18.04.

On the Sage side, we will not do anything to fix this issue so i suggest to close it.

Hi Thierry,

It seems I may need assistance in closing the ticket.

These are the only fields I'm able to see in the Change Properties form:


```
Summary: 	
Description:
Type: 	
Priority: 	
Milestone: 	
Component: 	
Keywords: 		Cc: 	
Merged in: 		Authors: 	
Reviewers: 		Report Upstream: 	
Work issues: 		Branch: 	
Commit: 		Dependencies: 	
Stopgaps: 			
```


And these are the only actions I'm able to perform at the Action form:


```
leave as positive_review
needs info
needs work
resubmit to review
assign to
unassign
accept
```


I tried accepting it, thinking it may grant me permission to close it (change the Resolution and Status fields), but it seems I don't have enough permissions: https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/TracTickets#edit-permissions.
