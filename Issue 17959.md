# Issue 17959: Move base_ring to category framework

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Currently, `base_ring` has a default implementation in `sage.structure.category_object`, which overrides any `base_ring` methods defined in categories.  This ticket aims to allow the definition of `base_ring` on categories.
