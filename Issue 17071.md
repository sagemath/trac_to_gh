CC:  @kcrisman

`sws2rst` abuses `tempfile.gettempdir()` such that it breaks if `os.path.join(tempfile.gettempdir(), file_name)` happens to exist already (in particular, if the original `.sws` file was stored in `/tmp`).

Also, I don't like

```
    try:
        process_sws(file_name)
    except Exception as e:
        print "Unable to process file ('%s')" % file_name
        print "Error message: %s" % e
        print "Exiting."
        sys.exit(1)
```

I would much rather see a full traceback rather than a "beautified" useless error message.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17308

Yes, and you can add yourself to the author log too since you added me.

Regarding your original remark

```
This strange assumption should also be removed:
Remark:

    The sws file(s) should be in the current directory; using an
    absolute path will result in an error."""
```

see [comment:39:ticket:10637 here] and [comment:65:ticket:10637 here] - and Pablo said he did it, but somehow it didn't make it in.   But it turned out that switching to `mkdtemp()` completely removed the problem anyway, since the only place two paths were joined (as opposed to a path and a string like `'data'`, or something from a list of a directory) was there.  So you were okay to remove that, and I have tested it with the latest version.

How about a permissions error or something about too big of a file, or weird characters, or...? (Just brainstorming.)  That could be safely ignored; in the event of emergency, just don't copy that particular file, I guess that was the thinking.  Because after all otherwise you could never really use sws2rst at all on that worksheet.  Because of this, and because this was in the very first version Pablo put up, so I'm reluctant to have it removed.

Otherwise all should be well, I even tested some of the more unusual error possibilities by renaming/moving/not moving various files.

> I guess it comes down to whether it's worse to have references that don't work in the rst file, or no rst file at all, and I would lean middling-heavy on the latter.

A compromize could be to have an option `--rst-only` to create **just** the `.rst` file without the images.

We already have the help and sphinxify options, that seems reasonable.  Something like

```
parser.add_option("--rst-only",
                  action="store_true", dest="rst_only",
                  help="Create just a .rst file, without images or other resources")
```

I'm in the middle of a different branch right now, unfortunately, and am not yet comfortable enough with `git stash` to deal with this... - we'd need to update `usage` as well.  

Incidentally, the jmol images now start with pngs so it could be possible to extract those as well - obviously, not here!

If you agree, we could add the `--rst-only` in a different ticket.

Haha, true, except then I might do to you what you did to me in #17265 and make this ticket depend on that one ;-)

Well, I don't consider it a bug that `sage-sws2rst` gives an error if there was an error copying files...

Hmm, good point.   Though it's also a good point that this is a change in behavior.

However, enough bikeshedding; presumably this is used rarely enough in such cases (or at all?) that we should do that.  Put your fix there and I'll get to it at some point soon, this is a green light.
