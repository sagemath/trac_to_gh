# Issue 17757: rename method schuetzenberger_involution of Tableau to evacuation

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: opechenik

Original creation time: 2015-03-18 22:07:59

CC:  mariamonks opechenik darij

Keywords: tableau

"Evacuation" is the standard name for this operator. Probably appropriate to leave "schuetzenberger_involution" as a permanent alias.
