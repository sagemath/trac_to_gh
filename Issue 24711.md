The script `sage-package-list` is intended to list packages. We transform the "installed" category into a filter like option and allow a new category "all". That way
- `sage-list-package all --installed-only` lists installed packages
- `sage-list-package optional --installed-only` lists installed optional packages
The second option was unavailable before.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24948

Looks good to me.

Some tests done:
- `sage-list-packages installed` has a deprecation warning message.
- `sage-list-packages all --installed-only` and `sage-list-packages installed` returned the same package list.
- `sage-list-packages all --installed-only --not-installed-only` return a ValueError.
- Check there is no common element between `sage-list-packages all --installed-only` and `sage-list-packages all --not-installed-only`
- Check there is no common element between `sage-list-packages optional --installed-only` and `sage-list-packages optional --not-installed-only`
- Check there is no common element between `sage-list-packages standard --installed-only` and `sage-list-packages standard --not-installed-only`
- `sage-list-packages all --installed-only` union `sage-list-packages all --not-installed-only` same list as `sage-list-packages all`
