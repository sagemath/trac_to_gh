# Issue 28821: Tachyon rendering bug in non-POSIX/US locale

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29058

Original creator: embray

Original creation time: 2020-01-21 01:31:52

Short ticket for now just to note that locale settings like `LC_NUMERIC=fr_FR.UTF-8` result in commas instead of periods for decimal places when outputting tachyon scripts, causing them to fail to be parsed.
