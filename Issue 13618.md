Assignee: jason, was

CC:  @kcrisman madrosity

The `bezier_path` function will mangle the list that you give it, leading to unexpected behavior:


```
sage: bp = [[(1,1),(2,3),(3,3)], [(4,4),(5,5)]]
sage: bezier_path(bp)

sage: bp
[[(1, 1), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5)], [(4, 4), (5, 5)]]
```


Probable fix: `copy()` the list that is passed in.

Hellooooooooooo !!

Wouldn't a simple "copy" do the job ? Would it be wrong to just replace `self.path = path` by `self.path = list(path)` ?

Unless I messed up my testing, a plain `copy()` doesn't work. The `path` parameter is a list of lists, so if you do a simple copy, you get a brand new list containing all the old pointers to lists.

Even though `self.path` is a new list, this,


```
vertices = self.path[0]
```


sets `vertices` to the first element of that new list, which is one of the lists that the user passed in. Then this,


```
vertices += curve
```


modifies his list.
