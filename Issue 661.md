# Issue 661: Integrate Trac with SAGE Wiki

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/661

Original creator: malb

Original creation time: 2007-09-15 13:12:21

Assignee: was

Trac comes with its own Wiki and if something like LinBox is found in a user submitted test, it is enhanced with a link to that wiki instance. As we don't use this wiki but have our own at http://wiki.sagemath.org we should change that behavior such that the link points to our wiki instead.

I am not sure this is a desired or even achievable feature. 

Malb: Any opposition to closing this ticket as "wontfix"?

Cheers,

Michael
