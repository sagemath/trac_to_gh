This is not currently an issue since we haven't implemented it, but we should make it work.  See #12289.

```
sage: erf(1).n(algorithm='foo')
0.842700792949715
sage: erf(0)
0
sage: parent(erf(0))
Integer Ring
sage: erf(0).n(algorithm='foo')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I don't see any obvious problems with this.  How did you check whether you found all possible places where numerical approximation would potentially get this keyword?  Otherwise it looks good and ready to test, though patchbot hasn't gotten around to it.  Not sure what the story is on that.

I just searched the source for `_numerical_approx` methods, which is what gets called when the `numerical_approx` function is called on an object, which is what `Element` uses for the numerical approximation method as well.

Changing keywords from "" to "algorithm".

Rebased on 6.2.beta2. Everything builds and tests OK. Easy patch, positive. Hope it's OK to copy the author name from the patch.
