When using sagemath with Pyton 3.9, we have 

```sage
sage: L = list(range(5))                                                                                                            
sage: shuffle(L)                                                                                                                    
/Users/dcoudert/sage/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sage/misc/prandom.py:151: DeprecationWarning: The *random* parameter to shuffle() has been deprecated
since Python 3.9 and will be removed in a subsequent version.
  return _pyrand().shuffle(x, random)
```
