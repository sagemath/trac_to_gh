One doctest failure:

```
File "src/sage/geometry/polyhedron/plot.py", line 540, in sage.geometry.polyhedron.plot.Projection._init_dimension
Failed example:
    from sage.geometry.polyhedron.plot import Projection, render_2d
Exception raised:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/local/sage-patchbot/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/doctest/forker.py", line 659, in _run
        self.compile_and_execute(example, compiler, test.globs)
      File "/local/sage-patchbot/sage/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sage/doctest/forker.py", line 1070, in compile_and_execute
        exec(compiled, globs)
      File "<doctest sage.geometry.polyhedron.plot.Projection._init_dimension[0]>", line 1, in <module>
        from sage.geometry.polyhedron.plot import Projection, render_2d
    ImportError: cannot import name render_2d
```

Once fixed, you can set a positive review on my behalf.

This should be re-targeted for 8.5.
