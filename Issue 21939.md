Do you really want `Sage` with the capital letter? Having both `sage` and `Sage` in the same directory looks like a recipe for trouble.

More importantly, this ticket only solves a trivial technical aspect of release notes. Who will ensure that those news fragments get written? I can already see the 8.3 release with just one item in the changelog: `Towncrier is used to produce NEWS`.

I don't see the point of having a very incomplete `NEWS` file. We currently have a "changelog" in Sage which lists the titles of the merged tickets. This is already somewhat helpful, but there is room for improvement.

So if you want to propose something new, like towncrier, it should at least improve on the existing functionality. So you need to convince me why towncrier, listing just a few tickets, is better than the changelog which lists at least every ticket.

It cannot. Only the release manager (or by extension his scripts) can do that.

> have the appearance of being only for the sake of it

I can assure you that this is not the case. It's not that I enjoy complaining. It's more that I feel forced to point out these obvious flaws with your proposal, because nobody else has done that.

For the record: I am absolutely in favour of using something like towncrier. But this Trac ticket by itself does nothing: there needs to be a consensus on sage-devel on how to handle this. There should be a policy about it. Most importantly, the release manager must get involved: his scripts must be updated to enforce whatever policy we decide.

In fact there is a checklist the release manager goes through before reviewing a ticket.  Unfortunately that checklist is hard to find and not well published on tickets (it should be).
There should be a note (perhaps in the keywords field, or elsewhere on the ticket) specifying whether or not a NEWS entry should be required for the ticket.  There are cases where it is not needed; e.g. fixing bugs that only occur between development releases.  I would only bother with things that changed between major releases, personally.

We still need a policy about that changelog-on-Trac. I would propose the following (also for backwards compatibility):

- By default, every ticket has a changelog entry.

- If there is a changelog on Trac, use that.

- If there is no changelog on Trac, use the ticket title instead (which is what we've been doing so far for the release notes).

- We define a special reserved value for the Trac changelog (say `none`) to indicate that a ticket should not be in the changelog at all.

On the other hand, updating it with every beta allows "beta-testing" the changelog itself. Suppose that I see a typo or something unclear in the changelog of some beta, I could change the changelog entry before the final release.

Well, it would be good to *generate* the changelog for every beta.  I just mean it would be too much noise to add entries to the changelog for every change between beta versions (particularly bug fixes that never affected a final release).
