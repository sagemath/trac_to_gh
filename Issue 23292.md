It is really easy to get comparison of types wrong that have no order. This helper method should make this easier.

Changing component from python3 to documentation.

Just to start.  An example from the code that I am now looking at:

```
def _richcmp__(self, other, op):
    """
    Compare this ideal with the other ideal with respect to ``op``.
    ...
    """
    if self.ring() != other.ring():
        raise ValueError("rings must be the same")

    return richcmp(self.module(), other.module(), op)  
```


Feel free to suggest a better idiom.

Seriously `_richcmp__`? Is that a typo or is that the actual name?

That is a typo. It should be `_richcmp_`. Sorry.

OK, so let me comment. It is important to know that `_richcmp_` guarantees (through the coercion model) that both arguments have the same parent. For ideals, I would guess that this implies that the rings are the same. In that case, the check

```
if self.ring() != other.ring():
    raise ValueError("rings must be the same")
```

is redundant.

Then the example is simply


```
def _richcmp_(self, other, op):
    """
    Compare this ideal with the other ideal with respect to ``op``.
    ....
    """
    return richcmp(self.module(), other.module(), op) 
```


I think this is typical case indeed.

I wonder what happens (or should happen) when the parents are different after attempting coercion. I remember this is a controversial issue though...
