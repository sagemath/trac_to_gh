in `seems_feasible` in `graphs/strongly_regular_db.pyx` there are computations of multiplicities (f,g) of eigenvalues which silently overflow `int` for relatively modest values of parameters, e.g. for
a feasible tuple `(16384, 8256, 4160, 4160)`.

```
    f = -k*(s+1)*(k-s)//(mu*(r-s))
    g =  k*(r+1)*(k-r)//(mu*(r-s))
```

this should not be done with `int`.

As well, these computations should be done before `"Integrality condition"` check.

this was picked up while working with a construction from Designs, Codes and Cryptography (2021) 89:1993â€“2007 https://doi.org/10.1007/s10623-021-00896-2, namely, the 1st one on p 2005:

where `q` must be a power of 2.

It could be a bug in the patchbot plugin. Probably never looked at by anybody else than me.

Here is the regexp used:

```
    regexps = [r'\.\.SEE|SEE ALSO|SEEALSO:($|[^:])',
               r'^\s*TEST:', r'^\s*EXAMPLE:', r'^\s*NOTES:',

Do you see why `:trac:`32306` is fixed::` matches ?
