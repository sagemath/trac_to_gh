CC:  chapoton slelievre

Keywords: beginner, typo

Many code comments or docstrings have "can not" for "cannot".

To find them, change to the Sage root folder and run:


```bash
$ git grep "can not" src
```


This ticket is to fix that.

One might also search for (line ending with "can"
possibly followed by any number of whitespace characters)
followed by (line starting with "not" possibly preceded
by any number of whitespace characters).

I don't know how to do that.

Agree with `@`mantepse's comment but still think it's worth changing here.

I'm rephrasing the ticket summary and description to not call this a typo.

Positive review from me if the bots are happy.

I am aware the underlying non associativity that makes
"can not go" ambiguous: "(can not) go" and "can (not go)"
have different meanings. In speech, which meaning is meant
would be rendered by intonation.

Instead of "You can go but you can not go as well" one could
force the correct understanding of the implied word grouping
by saying "You can go but you can also not go".

In writing, "cannot" clarifies that "(can not) x" is meant
rather than "can (not x)" and this might be why English
has this compact single-word "cannot" form.

This is why I suggest to change all "can not" to "cannot"
in our source code, since they were all meant in the sense
"cannot" and this removes any ambiguity.

To delve further into linguistics, one could compare the
frequencies of "cannot" vs "can not" in our code base
prior to this ticket, or in other code bases,
see for instance in CPython:

- https://github.com/python/cpython/search?q="can+not"
- https://github.com/python/cpython/search?q="cannot"

and one could check for a possible correlation with
whether code was committed by native English speakers.

If nobody objects though, let us get this in.
