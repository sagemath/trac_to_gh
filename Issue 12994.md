Currently, q-binomials are calculated as a fraction of products of q-integers.  With the attached patch, q-binomials are computed as a product of cyclotomic polynomials.  This avoids reducing a fraction of polynomials and is significantly faster for larger q-binomial coefficients.

Before:

```
sage: from sage.combinat.q_analogues import *
sage: %timeit q_binomial(18,7)
125 loops, best of 3: 1.89 ms per loop
sage: %timeit q_binomial(180,70)
5 loops, best of 3: 1.4 s per loop
```

After:

```
sage: from sage.combinat.q_analogues import *
sage: %timeit q_binomial(18,7)
125 loops, best of 3: 2.01 ms per loop
sage: %timeit q_binomial2(180,70)
25 loops, best of 3: 34.7 ms per loop
```

Thank you for adding a reference!

I was trying to understand how docstrings in general are working... based on what I saw in other files, I have slightly modified your documentation (for instance, no double colon after REFERENCES and an underscore when citing the reference).  Please correct me if this is wrong.

Other than this nitpicking, I am happy with your addition.

You are correct, I tend to mess up the markup every now and then... ;-)
