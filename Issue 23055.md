# Issue 23055: Auto-generating index of functions and classes

Issue created by migration from Trac.

`sage.misc.rest_index_of_methods` provides convenient functions for auto-generating documentation for our growing lists of index and catalog pages. Currently it doesn't support including (imported) classes in the listing, but that is relevant in e.g. `sage.coding.codes_catalog` (whose doc is currently incorrect!)
