# Issue 12259: make palp respect global CC flag

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12431

The palp spkg currently does not respect the global CC flag, we should fix this (for instance for #12426).

I've posted an spkg at [http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/clang-port/sage-5.0.beta1-src/spkg/standard/palp-1.1.p4.spkg](http://wstein.org/home/ohanar/clang-port/sage-5.0.beta1-src/spkg/standard/palp-1.1.p4.spkg).

I guess changing the milestone and setting positive_review, you can do yourself, right?

Yes I can, I thought that duplicate was a release manager only status, not a milestone, oops :p.

The difference is between proposing the ticket as duplicate and actually closing it as duplicate.
