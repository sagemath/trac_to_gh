# Issue 14069: Remove workaround for sagenb pull request 84

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/14273

Original creator: roed

Original creation time: 2013-03-14 20:07:45

Assignee: mvngu

CC:  kini jdemeyer

In #12415 we added

```
# Workarounds for https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/pull/84
import sagenb.notebook.misc
import sagenb.notebook.sage_email
def fixed_default_email_address():
    import socket
    import getpass
    return getpass.getuser() + "@" + socket.gethostname()
sagenb.notebook.sage_email.default_email_address = fixed_default_email_address
```

to `sage.doctest.forker`.  These whould be removed once the newer version of sagenb is incorporated into Sage.

Assuming that [https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/pull/84](https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/pull/84) is merged, this patch is obviously fine.

These changes were apparently used as workarounds for the old sagenb in #12415. I ran the following

```
...allations/sage-5.11.beta3Â» ./sage -btp 2 --sagenb
```

and all the tests passed. So, removing this workaround looks ok to me now.
