Documentation needs to be in standard form. So

```
    - ``certificate`` -- (default: ``False``) If true, blablabla
```

The double backquotes are for code variables, the single backquotes are for math. Also note the way defaults are reported.

Documentation can be previewed by running

```
make doc
```

and then inspecting (starting from your base Sage directory)
