* Line 88 of `matroid.pyx` has been messed up
* At line 1110, you're missing an enter.
* Line 3893 has bonus whitespace.
* As on the `is_isomorphic()` ticket, you should explicitly call the option in the doctests.

Almost done (I feel like a grumpy old man...)

You've got repeated doctests now.

Should this ticket be in "needs review"?

Documentation needs to be in standard form. So

```
    - ``certificate`` -- (default: ``False``) If true, blablabla
```

The double backquotes are for code variables, the single backquotes are for math. Also note the way defaults are reported.

Documentation can be previewed by running

```
make doc
```

and then inspecting (starting from your base Sage directory)

```
local/share/doc/sage/html/en/reference/matroids/index.html
```

Each ticket needs a proper description (at least a line saying what is the goal). For example, there is no way to guess that all this is about matroids!!

In the clause 'if N is self' you should still return the tuple (X,Y,dic), where X = Y = frozenset() and `dic = {x: x for x in self.groundset()} `
