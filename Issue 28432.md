CC:  karimvanaelst

Keywords: integrated_curve, geodesic

In Sage 8.9, we have:

```
sage: E.<r,phi> = EuclideanSpace(coordinates='polar')
sage: p = E((1, 0))  # the initial point
sage: v = E.tangent_space(p)((2, 1))  # the initial vector
sage: t = var('t')
sage: c = E.integrated_geodesic(E.metric(), (t, 0, 10), v)
...
ValueError: initial point should be in the domain of the chart
```

Now, the initial point `p` does lie in the domain of the chart:

```
sage: E.default_chart()(p)
(1, 0)
```

Indeed, `0` is a perfectly valid value for the polar coordinate `phi`:

```
sage: E.default_chart().coord_range()
r: (0, +oo); phi: [0, 2*pi] (periodic)
```

The above error turns out to result from a too strict and unnecessary coordinate check performed in `IntegratedCurve.__init__()`. This check is removed here.
