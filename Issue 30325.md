It should download $HOST/upstream/gap/gap-4.11.0.tar.bz2, but goes for /upstream/gap_packages/ instead:

```

```
For now I'm manually copying the gap tarball to /gap_packages/, but would be nice to get this fixed.

}
```

It works if I already have the GAP tarball in upstream.
I believe it's usually will be the case, as gap is a dependency of gap_packages, thus the tarball will be fetched for gap, if gap is not installed.

I've also tested that removing the tarball from upstream triggers its downloading if gap is already installed, but gap_packages is not.

So, all good.
