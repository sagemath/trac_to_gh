# Issue 19514: Implement a generic multiplication method for dense matrices

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19751

Original creator: mmezzarobba

Original creation time: 2015-12-20 12:42:47

Surprisingly, `Matrix_dense` doesn't implement matrix multiplication, although the discussion of how to implement specialized matrix types in `matrix/docs.py` suggests it should. See also #17220.

`i` and `j` should be typed `Py_ssize_t`.

Replace `_mul_classical` by `_multiply_classical`.

Changed, but why? Cython seems to be able to infer that type.

Done, thanks.

I didn't check the C code. I didn't even know Cython could do that.


Something else: replace

```
raise IndexError("Number of columns of left must equal number of rows of right.")
```

by an `ArithmeticError`. The same exception occurs in Sage as `IndexError` and as `ArithmeticError` but I think the latter is the most suitable.

You also need to doctest this exception.

You should only use `_mul_` and `_add_` if you take advantage of `Element` typing. This is not the case here (Cython doesn't know what `get_unsafe()` returns).

I would just use `+` and `*` instead and then remove the typing for `dotp`.

Fine, but could you please explain why? The way I understand it, calling `_add_()`/`_mul_()` will still be faster, if very slightly (if that's not the case, I guess the documentation in `element.pyx` needs to be fixed), and more importantly, it makes it clear that the arguments already have the same parent.

By the way, do you know if there is a reason for `get_unsafe()` not to be `cdef RingElement`?

`x._mul_(y)` is faster *if Cython knows* that `x` and `y` are of type `RingElement`. Otherwise, `x * y` is faster.

After reading the code in `element.pyx` I think I understand, thanksâ€”though I still find the documentation a bit misleading.

Then why not `(<RingElement> x)._mul_(<RingElement> y)`? The the overhead might be negligible.

Well, I guess that's the other option Jeroen had in mind when he said he would just use `+`/`*`, and I honestly don't care much. That's just a fallback method that will essentially never be called.
