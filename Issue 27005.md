# Issue 27005: py3: strengthen a doctest in vertex_separation.pyx

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27242

Original creator: dcoudert

Original creation time: 2019-02-09 10:11:22

Keywords: py3, graph

The order in which solutions are found by the branch and bound algorithm depends on the order in which vertices are visited. Hence, this test sometimes answers 10 and some other times 11, and both answers are correct.

```
sage: from sage.graphs.graph_decompositions import vertex_separation as VS
sage: G = graphs.MycielskiGraph(5)
sage: vs, seq = VS.vertex_separation_BAB(G, cut_off=11); vs
10 or 11
```

We change it to a robust form

```
sage: VS.vertex_separation_BAB(G, cut_off=11)[0] <= 11
True
```
