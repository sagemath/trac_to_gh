Implement this:

```
sage: from sage.doctest.external import has_graphviz
sage: has_graphviz()
True
```


so that graphviz is included in the external software to be detected:


```
$ sage -t --optional=external src/sage/graphs/graph_latex.py
...
Using --optional=external
External software to be detected: cplex,graphviz,gurobi,internet,latex,
macaulay2,magma,maple,mathematica,matlab,octave,scilab
...
```


Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25305

I added `has_ffmpeg` and `have_imagemagick` in the second commit. 

For references, the list `tests_not_run` below contains all tags of tests that are not run by default. The list was obtained from `grep "not run"` on the log of `./sage -t -p --all --long --show-skipped`:


```
sage: tests_not_run = ['4ti2', 'and', 'axiom', 'beautifulsoup', 'benzene', 'bliss', 'buckygen',

And this is a tentative list of all "external" packages:


```
sage: S = set(package_versions('standard'))
sage: O = set(package_versions('optional'))
sage: E = set(package_versions('experimental'))
sage: set(tests_not_run) - (S|O|E)

Why better? To me adding three new `has_key` functions to the `external.py` module makes things better. But changing `has_maple` in a way that it uses `features` does not make anything better.

The way the `external.py` module is coded right now is that the presence of an external software with name `tag` is detected with a method whose name is `has_tag`. The goal of this ticket is not to redesign all of this `external.py` module.

I just realized that it is not possible for `has_maple`. The maple interface allows subtle configurations such as
- an alternative name for the executable
- a remote execution through ssh
This is not the kind of things a feature is aware of.

> The way the `external.py` module is coded right now is that the presence of an external software with name `tag` is detected with a method whose name is `has_tag`. The goal of this ticket is not to redesign all of this `external.py` module. So I suggest that further uses of feature inside of `external.py` be postpone to another ticket if this is at all pertinent.

In your situation, you are just checking for the presence of executable in the path. This is exactly what `sage.features.Executable` is about. The main difference between `has_XXX_ and a feature is that
- a feature is not only about doctest
- a feature can run small tests
- meaningful error messages
- this is not run twice in the same session

What I wanted to suggest with my message is to introduce `sage.features.graphviz`, `sage.features.ffmpeg` and `sage.features.imagemagick` and simply use

```
def has_ffmpeg():
    from sage.features.ffmpeg import FFmpeg
    return FFmpeg.is_present()
```

The software `FFmpeg` is indeed used in other parts of Sage (e.g. `animate`) and it would help to have it as a feature.
