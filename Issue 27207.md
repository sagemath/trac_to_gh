CC:  @ClementPernet

Dense linear algebra mod small p uses fflas-ffpack over float or double.
This library support multithreading for some routines: 
- matrix-matrix multiplication
- PLUQ decomposition
- etc.

This ticket proposes to expose these parallel variants to Sage user.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27444

For the record: matrix multiplication over finite field works in parallel. The following experiment is on a 12 cores Intel skylake-x server:

The speed-up of 6 for a 12 core machine is below what a self-standing fflas-ffpack achieves.
We need to investigate the reasons: alignment, strassen-winograd threshold, numa placement, etc.

I guess the reason is to avoid the overhead of using the sigs when the call is with a tiny instance which runs almost instantly and will therefore have no chance of being interrupted.
