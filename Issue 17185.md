# Issue 17185: symbolic sums with known parameters should simplify()

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/17422

Original creator: rws

Original creation time: 2014-12-01 10:19:33

A minimal case:

```
sage: (k,n) = var('k,n')
sage: f(n)=sum(abs(-k*k+n),k,1,n)
sage: f(n=8)
sum(abs(-k^2 + 8), k, 1, 8)
```

I would expect `f(n=8).simplify()` or `.expand()` to give me the result `162` but this does not work.

Related to #9424. One may depend on the other. Relevant questions were:
