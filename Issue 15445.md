# Issue 15445: tachyon (Sage6.0) does not build on Raspberry Pi (armv6l)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/15682

Original creator: wluebbe

Original creation time: 2014-01-15 13:56:44

CC:  jpflori

This was already mentioned in http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/10820 (comments 10 and 11), but no ticket was opened.
Note: The problem was also mentioned by jpflori in http://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/ExoticPorts.

A fix is to copy the 3 lines for armv7l in spkg-install (lines 84 to 86) and c/7/6/.  
Since I am new to Trac and git it may take me some time to create the fix :-/

Changing keywords from "" to "armv6l, Raspberry Pi".

Could you also add support for sparc?
Same fix...

Hi jpflori,
 
I succeeded in uploading my first branch :-).
If you tell exactly, how to add the sparc support, I will add it to spkg-install ...

As tested Tachyon Sage 6.0 now builds.

Hi, you should bump the .p* part of the version in package-version.txt (or stg like that). And it should be good to go!
I'll take care of sparc later.

Ok, so after discussing at https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-release/9qui3onr26o/TrrfydJqmIMJ we don't have to update the patch level nor SPKG.txt.
Please don't do anything, I'll revert these changes in a "reviewer" branch and put the ticket to positive_review.
