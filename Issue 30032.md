We reduce space usage from `O(n^2)` to `O(n)` in the computation of distances distribution of unweighted (di)graphs by avoiding to compute and store into memory the full distance matrix.

Why don't you use `calloc` for `count`? I heard it might be faster, because sometimes the allocator knows where memory initialized to `0` is. It's also one less line.

Otherwise looks good.

You are right, it's better to use calloc here.

Thank you.
