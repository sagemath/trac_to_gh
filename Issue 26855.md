Keywords: maxima, binomial, series

As [reported on Ask SageMath](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/45136/bug-in-computing-sum-of-binomials/):


```
sage: sum(binomial(1,n),n,0,oo)
3
sage: sum(binomial(1,n),n,0,oo,algorithm='sympy')
2
```


The error can be traced back to Maxima as follows: evaluating



```
sum(binomial(1,n),n,0,oo)
```


returns 



```
from sage.calculus.calculus import symbolic_sum
symbolic_sum(binomial(1,n),n,0,oo)
```


which calls


```
maxima_calculus.sr_sum(binomial(1,n),n,0,oo)
```


which returns 



```
from sage.interfaces.maxima_lib import max_to_sr, maxima_eval, max_ratsimp, max_simplify_sum, max_sum, sr_to_max
args = [binomial(1,n), n, 0, oo]
max_to_sr(maxima_eval([[max_ratsimp],[[max_simplify_sum],([max_sum],[sr_to_max(SR(a)) for a in args])]]))
```


Indeed we can see the bug in Maxima's simplify_sum:


```
(%i1) load("simplify_sum");
(%i2) simplify_sum(sum(binomial(1,n),n,0,inf));
(%o2)                                  3
```


I [reported this upstream](https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/3521/) (no feedback yet).
