# Issue 26855: sum(binomial(1,n),n,0,oo) should be 2 instead of 3 (error due to maxima)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/27092

Original creator: rburing

Keywords: maxima, binomial, series

As [reported on Ask SageMath](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/45136/bug-in-computing-sum-of-binomials/):


```
sage: sum(binomial(1,n),n,0,oo)
3
sage: sum(binomial(1,n),n,0,oo,algorithm='sympy')
2
```


The error can be traced back to Maxima as follows: evaluating



```
sum(binomial(1,n),n,0,oo)
```


returns 



```
from sage.calculus.calculus import symbolic_sum
symbolic_sum(binomial(1,n),n,0,oo)
```


which calls


```
maxima_calculus.sr_sum(binomial(1,n),n,0,oo)
```


which returns 



```
from sage.interfaces.maxima_lib import max_to_sr, maxima_eval, max_ratsimp, max_simplify_sum, max_sum, sr_to_max
args = [binomial(1,n), n, 0, oo]
max_to_sr(maxima_eval([[max_ratsimp],[[max_simplify_sum],([max_sum],[sr_to_max(SR(a)) for a in args])]]))
```


Indeed we can see the bug in Maxima's simplify_sum:


```
(%i1) load("simplify_sum");
(%i2) simplify_sum(sum(binomial(1,n),n,0,inf));
(%o2)                                  3
```


I [reported this upstream](https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/3521/) (no feedback yet).

Ticket retargeted after milestone closed (if you don't believe this ticket is appropriate for the Sage 8.8 release please retarget manually)

maxima-5.43.0:  simplify_sum still has bug

Bug has a couple possible fixes upstream but apparently no commit yet.

As the Sage-8.8 release milestone is pending, we should delete the sage-8.8 milestone for tickets that are not actively being worked on or that still require significant work to move forward.  If you feel that this ticket should be included in the next Sage release at the soonest please set its milestone to the next release milestone (sage-8.9).

Changing component from interfaces to symbolics.

This is now fixed in Maxima, in a version we use in Sage.

The only thing missing to close this ticket is a doctest.
