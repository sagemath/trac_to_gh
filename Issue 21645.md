This patch will speed up computation of join matrix in lattices. On 1024-element Boolean lattice


```
H = Posets.BooleanLattice(10).hasse_diagram()
H.relabel(lambda x: x+1)  # To clear possible caches.
P = Poset(H)
```


Before/after the patch:


```
1 loops, best of 1: 2.86 s per loop
1 loops, best of 1: 1.23 s per loop
```


Time to count join-semilattices from all 9-element bounded posets drops from 710 ms to 278 ms.
