When building Sage we should install the ReST documentation into $SAGE_LOCAL somewhere, i.e. $SAGE_LOCAL/documentation/sage.

There is also no documentation in "sage -advanced" on how to build the documentation and that ought to be fixed before 3.4 gets out :)

Cheers,

Michael

Invalid - we should keep things in the output directory.

Cheers,
