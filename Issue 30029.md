Given that `ScalarField_repr_` does not print any contents, this hash does not seem to be useful to distinguish non-equal elements. This will degrade the performance of sets to that of lists.

More importantly, it must be ensured that `f == g` implies `hash(f) == hash(g)`. Because equality does not take names into account but `repr` does, this is currently not satisfied.

I just copied the ideas from the elsewhere in the Sage code. This means that most `hash` functions are implemented wrong.

Are you sure it is not `f is g` implies `hash(f) == hash(g)`? `f == g` implies `hash(f) == hash(g)` is barely possible in cases where coercions apply, isn't it?

Ah yes, I see, apparently that were cases where the string representation cannot be changed. Due to the fact that we allow restrictions as coercion, `hash(self._manifold)` seem to be the only choice.

I will add a related doctest for this particular case.

Ensuring that this implication holds across coercion is very difficult, and it is done in Sage on a "best effort" basis -- such as for QQ as the fraction field of ZZ.

The rule of thumb is that if we form sets, they should be of elements of the same parent so that no coercion is involved.  Likewise for the keys of dictionaries.

Since the restriction is set as a coercion, and they live in different sets, maybe we should make the hash more unique? Namely:


```diff
-        return hash((type(self).__name__, self._manifold))
+        return hash((type(self).__name__, self._domain))
```


If that is what we want, I will, of course, adapt the doctest section.

Actually, we didn't. But that is a crucial point! Without analyticity, which is not necessarily given, the transitivity is definitely violated.

However, coercible objects have to be comparable, right?
