Hello,

This will be a problem for building pdf docs (closing `}` with no opening)

```
+ (2) `X(P[0]^g}/P[1]) = P` and `X(Q[0]^g/Q[1]) = Q` if `P, Q` are in the infinite disc
```


The `diffxy` stuff is duplicated

```
from sage.misc.derivative import multi_derivative
sage: p = u**2 + v**3*u**5 + u**5 + v**6
sage: multi_derivative(p, (u,3,v,2))
360*u^2*v
```

(not exactly the purpose of this ticket though)
