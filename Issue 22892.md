I'm not convinced that we should mindlessly remove those parts of `sage-location`. I'm not saying it's neccessarily wrong, but I am saying that we should carefully think about it. I wouldn't be surprised if this would unexpectedly break stuff.

`make_scripts_relative` needs to go, or at the very least we need to use the change from #23039: now that we always build Python 3, there are scripts which are intentionally written to use `/path/to/python3` (like `pip3`) which end up having their first lines rewritten as `#!/usr/bin/env python`.

With the current branch, all tests pass for me, but I understand that this is not convincing evidence. Maybe it is best to view my branch as the start of a conversation.
