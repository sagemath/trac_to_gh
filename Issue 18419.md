Since `T` is computed each time, why not returning it by default? If you use a `cached_method` you should minimize the number of arguments.

Also, make the output matrices immutable.

Done, I made `rational_diagonal_form()` a front-end for a cached function `_rational_diagonal_form_and_transformation()` which returns the form and matrix.
