The libc `setjmp`/`longjmp` functions of OpenSolaris 06.2009-32 on i686 hardware do not fully restore the x87 FPU state, in particular when MMX instructions have been used.  The proposed solution is to execute the `EMMS` instruction before `longjmp()`.  For more context, see #12777 where this bug was discovered.

Well, actually it's not so clear whether `longjmp()` should restore the FPU state.  I'll try to see whether I can reproduce the problem on Linux i686.
