# Issue 11100: cube(center, size=0.5) does not return a cube centered at center

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/11272

Original creator: slabbe

Original creation time: 2011-04-28 18:42:26

Assignee: jason, was

Keywords: cube

The center of the cube is affected by the argument size :


```
sage: c = cube(center=(10,10,10), size=0.5)              
sage: c.bounding_box()                            
((4.75, 4.75, 4.75), (5.25, 5.25, 5.25))          
```


The intended behavior is that the center is independant of the size:


```
sage: c = cube((10,10,10), size=0.5)              
sage: c.bounding_box()  
((9.75, 9.75, 9.75), (10.25, 10.25, 10.25))  
```

Problem is fixed. All test passed in the directory `sage/plot/plot3d`. Documentation builds fine. Positive review. Thanks for the fix!

Needs to be rebased to sage-4.7.rc1

It seems to work properly in sage-4.7.rc1 without patches.  Apparently the bug has already been fixed in another ticket.

I wonder if the doctest could be added to Sage anyway. Can we reopen the ticket for it?
