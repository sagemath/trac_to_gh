# Issue 30137: Improve unicode art for callable symbolic expressions

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30374

Original creator: mkoeppe

Original creation time: 2020-08-16 03:25:44

CC:  tscrim @mwageringel chapoton egourgoulhon

Currently we have:

```
sage: s(t) = t^3; s
t |--> t^3
sage: %display unicode_art
 3
t
```

In this ticket, we add the missing mapsto arrow, perhaps using '\u21a6' or '\u27fc':

```
      3
t ⟼ t
```

Sage development has entered the release candidate phase for 9.3. Setting a new milestone for this ticket based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.

I would rather vote for `↦` (U+21A6). It's simple and quite readable after all (especially if surrounded by one space on each side). Moreover, it's a single-character symbol, which may avoid some line feed for long expressions (only when the line feed is up to 2 characters).

I would prefer ⟼ (but apparently bad for the mac guys)

Not only for the mac guys: in my Ubuntu terminal, I have

![](unicode_mapsto.png)

So not only U+27FC does not appear longer, but it is even less clear than U+21A6.

Well, clearly this will depend a lot on people's fonts. We can never be sure to please everybody.
