CC:  @tscrim @mwageringel @fchapoton @egourgoulhon

Currently we have:

```
sage: s(t) = t^3; s
t |--> t^3
sage: %display unicode_art
 3
t
```

In this ticket, we add the missing mapsto arrow, perhaps using '\u21a6' or '\u27fc':

```
      3
t ⟼ t
```

I would rather vote for `↦` (U+21A6). It's simple and quite readable after all (especially if surrounded by one space on each side). Moreover, it's a single-character symbol, which may avoid some line feed for long expressions (only when the line feed is up to 2 characters).

Not only for the mac guys: in my Ubuntu terminal, I have

So not only U+27FC does not appear longer, but it is even less clear than U+21A6.

Well, clearly this will depend a lot on people's fonts. We can never be sure to please everybody.
