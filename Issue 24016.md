```
sage: R.<a> = LaurentSeriesRing(QQ)
sage: R.order??
Source:
    def order(self):
        """
        The number of elements of ``self``.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: GF(19).order()
            19
            sage: QQ.order()
            +Infinity
        """
        if self.is_zero():
            return 1
        raise NotImplementedError
sage: R.cardinality??
Source:
    def cardinality(self):
        """
        Return the cardinality of the underlying set.

        OUTPUT:

        Either an integer or ``+Infinity``.

        EXAMPLES::

            sage: Integers(7).cardinality()
            7
            sage: QQ.cardinality()
            +Infinity
        """
        if not self.is_finite():
            from .infinity import Infinity
            return Infinity
        raise NotImplementedError

This would also fix #8550
