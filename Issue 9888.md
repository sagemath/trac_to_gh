A monomial algebra is a quotient of a path algebra by an admissible ideal generated by paths (see Assem, Ibrahim; Simson, Daniel; Skowronski, Andrzej. Elements of the representation theory of associative algebras. Vol. 1.)

This module implement the class of monomial algebras, the class of elements of monomial algebras and some functions related to those classes, such as functions for the computation of Hochschild (co)homology of these algebras. For this computation the class of chain complexes is used.
