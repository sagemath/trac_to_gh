# Issue 31201: GH Actions: cygwin: Move rpy2 to TARGETS_OPTIONAL

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31438

Original creator: mkoeppe

As a follow up to #31409, which made `r` and `rpy2` optional.
We move the `rpy2` from `TARGETS` to `TARGETS_OPTIONAL` so that build errors do not block the later test stages.

Not this ticket's fault. The test runs are for the Singular upgrade in #25993
