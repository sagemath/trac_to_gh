CC:  @jdemeyer @antonio-rojas @timokau @kiwifb @slel

Distributions don't (and won't) install `/etc/sage-started.txt`. However, one doctests relies on the existance of `SAGE_LOCAL/etc/sage-started.txt`. So this fails everywhere/has to be patched away.

I do not see why this stamp file needs any content at all. And so as I understand this the function `_write_started_file()` can go away and just be a `touch`. If somebody wonders what this file is about, they should just grep the source code and look at its timestamp.

Or am I missing something?

As I remember, Jeroen added that, when he was the release manager, has a way of proving that sage was properly built and functioning at the end of the building process.

Distro very much prefer to do it by running the test suite before the final install of course.

I am fairly sure I whined to Jeroen when he introduced this. So it would make me quite happy if you just removed the file as well as the doctest.
