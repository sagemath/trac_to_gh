Keywords: simplicial complexes, shifting

This tickets implements the exterior and symmetric shifting of simplicial complexes.

For more details on this operation, see for example:

https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0303233
https://arxiv.org/abs/0709.3265

where the operation is discussed in detail.

I am still working on the function, but thought that I could upload my current working version.

I still would like to implement the symmetric shifting as well.
