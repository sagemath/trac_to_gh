This is in Maxima.  In the latest:

```

(%i1) integrate(sin(x^2)/(x^2),x,1,inf);

defint: integral is divergent.
```

It used to just return the integral.

```

(%i1) integrate(sin(x^2)/(x^2),x,1,inf);
                                 inf
                                /         2
                                [    sin(x )
(%o1)                           I    ------- dx
                                ]       2
                                /      x
                                 1
```


I think this integral should converge, right?  By the p-test (well, with absolute values) for p=2?  And `numerical_integral` agrees with your thing.  This is probably a bug in Maxima, I'll put it there.

As far as I can tell, it's not fixed upstream - I have 5.25.1.  The bug report had a resolution but it was something where they apparently typed in the wrong integral.  

I am ignorant of how to use git and I can't do a text search for that commit line, unfortunately, so I'll take Laurent's word for it.   I've put that info on the bug tracker as well.
