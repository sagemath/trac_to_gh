Are things like

```
+.. backends depending on optional packages
+..   sage/numerical/backends/coin_backend
+..   sage/numerical/backends/cplex_backend
+..   sage/numerical/backends/gurobi_backend
+
```

some Sphinx directive I'm not familiar with?  Or are the `..` bits there superfluous?

Just comments. For some reason making a single comment block confuses the docbuilder, while it works if I comment each line with `..` (which is valid rst syntax as far as I know).

In that case, why not just include those (and the

```
+.. optional - cryptominisat
```

ones) and just make it really clear that they depend on optional packages?  We certainly get plenty of questions about MILP and backends, for instance.

Unfortunately, the doc building system fails (and complains loudly) if it can't import a module listed in one of the toctree blocks.

Oh yeah, I forgot about that.  Hmm, that is annoying.  Perhaps (not necessarily here) one could write a document referring to these which explain anything useful in them, but which is a pure documentation module.  (I know there is a thematic tutorial about these already in existence that explains a lot of it.)

What's this additional "docstring" in `src/sage/sandpiles/sandpile.py`?

```
"""
To calculate linear systems associated with divisors, 4ti2 must be installed.
One way to do this is to run sage -i to install glpk, then 4ti2. See
http://sagemath.org/download-packages.html to get the exact names of these
packages. An alternative is to install 4ti2 separately, then point the
following variable to the correct path.
"""
```

Shouldn't this be moved to the main docstring?

`Abstract SAT Solver.` -> `Abstract SAT Solver`

I would prefer to see

```
sage/modular/modform/notes
```

in a separate sub-section of the TOC.

Thanks! But actually the fixes to `number_field/*` were on the branch about `reference/rings` (#18169). So the problem here is that I apparently put some of the changes to index files depending on these fixes on this ticket's branch instead of the other one, and then made a mistake while testing that the tickets were independent. Anyway, I'm now rebasing both branchesâ€”and dropping your commit in the process to avoid conflicts.

I'm confused about what the lines

```
   sage/groups/perm_gps/partn_ref
   sage/groups/perm_gps/partn_ref2
```

in `reference/groups/index.rst` were supposed to accomplish, because in Sage 8.1.beta4, they lead to useless pages. (See http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/groups/sage/groups/perm_gps/partn_ref.html, for example.) Can anyone clarify?

(I would open a follow up ticket, but I think a good ticket description ought to say what is intended, and I have no idea in this case.)

Comment by jdemeyer created at 2017-09-12 10:18:42

I guess what was meant is the various modules inside those directories instead of the empty `__init__.py` module: #23839

I don't remember for sure, sorry, but I guess Jeroen is right. (Most probably, I automated part of the changes and didn't notice the issue.) In any case, the general goal of the branch was to ensure that all sage modules (well, except for a few special cases) were included in the reference manual.
