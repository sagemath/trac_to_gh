# Issue 19199: fixup of 19431: convert asymptotic expansion to the symbolic ring

#19431 changed `SymbolicRing._element_constructor_` which was not needed. A method `_symbolic_` suffices in the AsymptoticRing. An additional parameter `R` in `.symbolic_expression` will be needed to make it work.

LGTM.

doctests pass, documentation builds, code seems to be fine.
