On some patchbots, I see this:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/interfaces/gap.py
**********************************************************************
File "src/sage/interfaces/gap.py", line 1351, in sage.interfaces.gap.Gap.help
Failed example:
    print(gap.help('SymmetricGroup', pager=False))
Expected:
    <BLANKLINE>
      50.1-... SymmetricGroup
    <BLANKLINE>
      ‣ SymmetricGroup( [filt, ]deg ) ─────────────────────────────────── function
    ...
    <BLANKLINE>
Got:
    <BLANKLINE>
    <BLANKLINE>
      50.1-10 SymmetricGroup
    <BLANKLINE>
      > SymmetricGroup( [filt, ]deg ) ----------------------------------- function
[..many more lines..]
```

This seems to be a matter of unicode output or not.

Please provide a link to the full log. It is not clear whether "many more lines" mean more errors or not.

For this particular one I am inclined just to add more `...`

I don't think Sage must produce the same output for different locales, or whatever the real reason for this discrepancy is (perhaps just a patchbot bug).

I don't know where it was, but the problem is obvious.

So you consider a patchbot environment broken if it doesn't support UTF-8? We generally try to support UTF-8 and non-UTF-8 locales in Sage doctests.

And if you're really convinced that it's a patchbot problem, this bug should be closed as "workforme", not downgraded to "minor".

To clarify, in this case the test in question is only affected by the pexpect interface.  So the output from GAP in that case is going to depend on the environment passed when starting gap.
