The DSage doctests still cause trouble. Disable them for now until we start merging fixes again in 3.4.alpha0.

Cheers,

As the release manager, this seems like mabshoff's call, so I will give a positive review.  He has indicated that there enough known issues that additional testing for upcoming releases is not worthwhile.
