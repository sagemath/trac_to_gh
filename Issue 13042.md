# Issue 13042: Frobenius endomorphism over finite fields

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/13214

Original creator: caruso

Original creation time: 2012-07-09 08:26:03

Assignee: AlexGhitza

CC:  tfeulner caruso darij jpflori pbruin defeo jcooley dfesti

Keywords: frobenius finite fields

Here is a patch implementing:

 1. Frobenius endomorphisms over finite fields (generic implementation, plus special implementations for prime finite fields and givaro finite fields)
 1. embeddings between finite fields (with again a special implementation for givaro finite fields)
 1. hashing and rich comparisons for general morphisms

I guess your patch should also contain some *.pxd files since I receive the following error message.

Xavier, if I define an element of GF(q<sup>2</sup>) which is in fact an element of GF(q), will this patch enable to convert it efficiently to the smaller field? If so, please can you tell me how?

Paul

Oh sorry, I forgot *.pxd files. Thanks!


Paul, the answer to your question is probably yes... at least if q is small enough so that you can work with givaro fields (otherwise, it won't be so efficient).

Actually, I have not implemented automatic coercions between finite fields (essentially because embeddings between finite fields are not canonical). As a consequence it's not so easy to create embeddings. Nevertheless, here is what you can do:


```
sage: K.<x> = GF(5^3)
sage: L.<y> = GF(5^6)
sage: from sage.rings.finite_rings.hom_finite_field_givaro import FiniteFieldEmbedding_givaro
sage: f = FiniteFieldEmbedding_givaro(K,L); f
Embedding of Finite Field in x of size 5^3 into Finite Field in y of size 5^6
sage: g = f.section(); g
Section of Embedding of Finite Field in x of size 5^3 into Finite Field in y of size 5^6
sage: g(y^126)
3*x^2 + 1
sage: g(y)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: y is not in the image of Embedding of Finite Field in x of size 5^3 into Finite Field in y of size 5^6
```


If you are sure that you won't never use another embedding of K into L, you can even define f as a coerce map as follows:


```
sage: K._unset_coercions_used()
sage: K._populate_coercion_lists_(embedding=f)
```


Then the following will work:


```
sage: L(x)
2*y^5 + 3*y^4 + 3*y^2 + y + 2
sage: z = x*y; z
3*y^5 + 3*y^4 + 4*y^2 + 2*y + 1
sage: K(z/y)
x
sage: K(y)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: y is not in the image of Embedding of Finite Field in x of size 5^3 into Finite Field in y of size 5^6
```

Dear Paul,

I cannot reproduce the three last failures on my computer[*]. Could you please give me the complete output of 'sage -t'?

[*] I'm currently working with sage 5.1.rc0; it's probably the reason.

I changed the coercion in sage/rings/finite_rings/homset.py. Now, this patch passes all doctests except for the one documented in sage/categories/modules_with_basis.py. I did not change the error messages there, because I wanted to discuss the failure first.

Comment by caruso created at 2012-10-22 13:40:46

Thanks for catching this!

I now understand why I didn't see this failure: it's just because this patch actually depends on #13184 and that the corresponding patch was applied on my computer. Sorry for this!

I also attach a new version of my patch fixing the problem in modules_with_basis.py; I'm not really happy with my solution (but it has the advantage to be very short). Please let me now if you have some comment!

I've just posted a patch that should apply on sage-5.10 (let's wait and see).

Jean-Pierre, I was actually not aware about your work with David Roe on lattices of finite fields. I had a quick look at what you have implemented. Unfortunately, it seems to me that our philosophy is a bit different: if I understand correctly, you are trying to make all finite fields canonical whereas my idea was to ask explicitely to the user which embeddings (between finite fields) are canonical and which ones are not.

But, you're right. We should definitely understand precisely how our respective patches relate and merge them if necessary (or discard one of them, i.e. mine).

Note: Actually, my main motivation for this patch was to implement Frobenius endomorphisms. I think you patch does not provide this functionality. Is that correct?


---

Comment by jpflori created at 2013-06-26 08:53:56

I agree that the purposes of both patches are quite orthogonal: the point of our patch is a first step toward having compatible embeddings in lattices of finite fields automatically, i.e. mimic what Magma does where the user does not have to pay attention to such things and it just works.

And I feel we should merge both patches if possible, even if at some later point it could make sense to refactor some pieces of code.

Comment by pbruin created at 2013-06-26 14:05:15

This looks interesting.  One question at the moment: it does not appear to relate to the basic functionality that currently exists (in `sage/rings/finite_rings/homset.py`).  Is that intentional?  I can already type, for example,

```
sage: F9.<a>=GF(3^2)         
sage: F81.<b>=GF(3^4)
sage: f=F9.hom((b^10,))        
sage: f
Ring morphism:
  From: Finite Field in a of size 3^2
  To:   Finite Field in b of size 3^4
  Defn: a |--> 2*b^3 + 2*b^2 + 1
sage: f(a^2+a)
b^3 + b^2
sage: type(f)
<class 'sage.rings.finite_rings.homset.FiniteFieldHomomorphism_im_gens'>
```

As for the differing purposes of the two approaches, there should probably be two categories into which a finite field can be put:

- the category of all finite fields.  In this category, between any two objects there are either several morphisms or none at all, but no canonical one.

- the category of finite subfields of a given algebraic closure of *F*<sub>_p_</sub>.  In this category there is at most one morphism beteen any two objects, namely the inclusion qua subfields of the given algebraic closure.

Which is basically what we currently have and also what this ticket does.

I would like this to be the default at some point, just like in Magma, not because I want to replicate Magma but for usual computations it seems a more practical choice.
#8335 provides such an imlementation, though it not really practical for large fields and there is no proper categorical framework as you suggest.

This framework could be implemented in an independent ticket (and should if we want to be able to merge some tickets in a finite amount of time).

Yes, and precisely for this reason I think it is important to have a clear picture of what belongs in the "category of all finite fields" framework, what belongs in the future "finite subfields of a given algebraic closure" framework, and what is independent of the framework.  Among the category-independent things would certainly be the various classes implementing the interfaces to FLINT, Givaro, NTL and PARI, and to a large extent the `FiniteField` base class itself.

That probably depends strongly on the application.  Often one just needs to work with a single finite field.  In such cases it would be nicer if creating this field would give you a sparse polynomial for efficiency, not one that has been constructed to fit in an algebraic closure that you are unlikely to use.

Of course it would be best if one could do both at the same time, like Magma (see references at #8751), by having an implementation that allows using sparse polynomials while still being able to put the fields in a compatible system/algebraic closure.  However, that should probably be done on top of the distinction between the two categories mentioned above, not by muddling this distinction.

Yes, more or less.

Actually, my first motivation was to implement Frobenius endomorphism and, according to me, FrobeniusEndomorphism should not derive from RingHomomorphism_im_gens. Indeed, defining Frobenius endomorphisms by giving its value on the generator is not really appropriate for many operations we would like to perform (i.e. evaluation if the field has a small characteristic and a big size, composition, computation of the order or of the subfield of fixed points).

On the other hand, I agree that it makes sense to derive the various classes of embeddings from FiniteFieldHomomorphism_im_gens. I can actually change this if you think that it is better.

This sounds good.
And the second category should be a subcategory of the first one, right (a finite subfield of a given algebraic closure of *F*<sub>_p_</sub> is in particular a finite field)? If so, all category-independant functions should go to the first category (even if the second one is the default, as suggested by Jean-Pierre). This is the case in particular for Frobenius endomorphisms.

This might be a good target for Sage Days 51 (22-26 July, [http://wiki.sagemath.org/sagedaysleiden](http://wiki.sagemath.org/sagedaysleiden)).  For now I just checked that the patch applies to 5.11.beta3 (with some fuzz) and passes doctests.  I got one failure (a different embedding than expected is generated), probably because I am working under #14888.

In principle I am giving this a positive review, but since the reviewer patch I just uploaded contains some non-trivial changes, I think it is best if someone else reviews those changes first.

Summary of changes in [attachment:trac_13214-reviewer.patch]:
- Do not add `inverse()` method to `Section`; it is currently not used and does not seem to be the best name, since its return value (the original map) is only a one-sided inverse.
- Add method `gens()` to `CombinatorialFreeModule` to fix a doctest failure in `modules_with_basis.py`.  I guess this is the same failure discussed in comment:14 above.
- Rename `[Section]FiniteFieldEmbedding_*` to `[Section]FiniteFieldHomomorphism_*`; even though finite field homomorphisms are automatically injective, I think "homomorphism" fits better with existing code.  Furthermore, to me "embedding" makes it sound too much like finite field homomorphisms are canonical.
- Derive `FiniteFieldHomomorphism_generic` from `RingHomomorphism_im_gens` as suggested above.
- Replace the existing `FiniteFieldHomomorphism_im_gens` by the new `FiniteFieldHomomorphism_generic`.
- Better integration of the new code into the existing finite field code.
- Remove the `_repr_()` method of `FiniteFieldHomomorphism_generic`, so that the output is the same as for the old `FiniteFieldHomomorphism_im_gens`.
- Do not automatically generate a section for every finite field homomorphism.
- Numerous whitespace edits and some other typographical changes.

I'm currently at Sage Days 53 and could spare some time on this one... unless Luca is nearing completion of his review?

If I understand correctly, what needs to be done is to check Peter's changes as he already went over what Xavier did?

I'm rather nearing completion of the new class I'm starting next week... so feel free to go ahead :)

Yes, it would be nice if you could take a look either at my reviewer patch or at the combined one (the combined patch is only a little larger and probably easier to review).
