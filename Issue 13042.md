Keywords: frobenius finite fields

Here is a patch implementing:

1. Frobenius endomorphisms over finite fields (generic implementation, plus special implementations for prime finite fields and givaro finite fields)
2. embeddings between finite fields (with again a special implementation for givaro finite fields)
3. hashing and rich comparisons for general morphisms

Xavier, if I define an element of GF(q<sup>2</sup>) which is in fact an element of GF(q), will this patch enable to convert it efficiently to the smaller field? If so, please can you tell me how?

Paul, the answer to your question is probably yes... at least if q is small enough so that you can work with givaro fields (otherwise, it won't be so efficient).

Actually, I have not implemented automatic coercions between finite fields (essentially because embeddings between finite fields are not canonical). As a consequence it's not so easy to create embeddings. Nevertheless, here is what you can do:


```
sage: K.<x> = GF(5^3)
sage: L.<y> = GF(5^6)
sage: from sage.rings.finite_rings.hom_finite_field_givaro import FiniteFieldEmbedding_givaro
sage: f = FiniteFieldEmbedding_givaro(K,L); f
Embedding of Finite Field in x of size 5^3 into Finite Field in y of size 5^6
sage: g = f.section(); g
Section of Embedding of Finite Field in x of size 5^3 into Finite Field in y of size 5^6
sage: g(y^126)
3*x^2 + 1
sage: g(y)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: y is not in the image of Embedding of Finite Field in x of size 5^3 into Finite Field in y of size 5^6
```


If you are sure that you won't never use another embedding of K into L, you can even define f as a coerce map as follows:


```
sage: K._unset_coercions_used()
sage: K._populate_coercion_lists_(embedding=f)
```


Then the following will work:


```
sage: L(x)
2*y^5 + 3*y^4 + 3*y^2 + y + 2
sage: z = x*y; z
3*y^5 + 3*y^4 + 4*y^2 + 2*y + 1
sage: K(z/y)
x
sage: K(y)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
ValueError: y is not in the image of Embedding of Finite Field in x of size 5^3 into Finite Field in y of size 5^6
```

Not sure how this relates to #8335, but it might be worth having a look there.

I would like this to be the default at some point, just like in Magma, not because I want to replicate Magma but for usual computations it seems a more practical choice.
#8335 provides such an imlementation, though it not really practical for large fields and there is no proper categorical framework as you suggest.

This framework could be implemented in an independent ticket (and should if we want to be able to merge some tickets in a finite amount of time).

Yes, and precisely for this reason I think it is important to have a clear picture of what belongs in the "category of all finite fields" framework, what belongs in the future "finite subfields of a given algebraic closure" framework, and what is independent of the framework.  Among the category-independent things would certainly be the various classes implementing the interfaces to FLINT, Givaro, NTL and PARI, and to a large extent the `FiniteField` base class itself.

> > - the category of finite subfields of a given algebraic closure of **F**<sub>*p*</sub>.  In this category there is at most one morphism beteen any two objects, namely the inclusion qua subfields of the given algebraic closure.

That probably depends strongly on the application.  Often one just needs to work with a single finite field.  In such cases it would be nicer if creating this field would give you a sparse polynomial for efficiency, not one that has been constructed to fit in an algebraic closure that you are unlikely to use.

Of course it would be best if one could do both at the same time, like Magma (see references at #8751), by having an implementation that allows using sparse polynomials while still being able to put the fields in a compatible system/algebraic closure.  However, that should probably be done on top of the distinction between the two categories mentioned above, not by muddling this distinction.

This sounds good.
And the second category should be a subcategory of the first one, right (a finite subfield of a given algebraic closure of **F**<sub>*p*</sub> is in particular a finite field)? If so, all category-independant functions should go to the first category (even if the second one is the default, as suggested by Jean-Pierre). This is the case in particular for Frobenius endomorphisms.

In principle I am giving this a positive review, but since the reviewer patch I just uploaded contains some non-trivial changes, I think it is best if someone else reviews those changes first.

Summary of changes in [attachment:trac_13214-reviewer.patch]:
- Do not add `inverse()` method to `Section`; it is currently not used and does not seem to be the best name, since its return value (the original map) is only a one-sided inverse.
- Add method `gens()` to `CombinatorialFreeModule` to fix a doctest failure in `modules_with_basis.py`.  I guess this is the same failure discussed in comment:14 above.
- Rename `[Section]FiniteFieldEmbedding_*` to `[Section]FiniteFieldHomomorphism_*`; even though finite field homomorphisms are automatically injective, I think "homomorphism" fits better with existing code.  Furthermore, to me "embedding" makes it sound too much like finite field homomorphisms are canonical.
- Derive `FiniteFieldHomomorphism_generic` from `RingHomomorphism_im_gens` as suggested above.
- Replace the existing `FiniteFieldHomomorphism_im_gens` by the new `FiniteFieldHomomorphism_generic`.
- Better integration of the new code into the existing finite field code.
- Remove the `_repr_()` method of `FiniteFieldHomomorphism_generic`, so that the output is the same as for the old `FiniteFieldHomomorphism_im_gens`.
- Do not automatically generate a section for every finite field homomorphism.
- Numerous whitespace edits and some other typographical changes.
