There are many failing doctests in sage.rings.asymptotic; fix them.

Many of them fail due to #26145 (which is part of the hashing issue of #24551).

I've fixed the Python3-issues (tested with 8.5.beta2, but branch is based on 8.4 as it will be merged into #26587 to prevent a conflict there).

FYI, it seems that Git can merge this correctly, so no new dependency for #26587.
