There is no `build/pkgs/X/distros/gentoo.txt` for `X in {m4rie, eclib}` - which are otherwise perfectly OK.

Also, gentoo's cbc package is present, but outdated, so Sage can't use it. Perhaps, update?

I'm working on CoinOR in Gentoo, but there are several packages I have to update at the same time, all with bugs open, and all sharing the same dumpster fire build system.

Our package for m4rie is `sci-libs/m4rie` and eclib is `sci-mathematics/eclib[flint]`. You can just add those and make this positive review on my behalf if you want. It's a trivial change.

I had a go 6 months ago but ended up in a big mess. I unfortunately didn't put it on git and have nothing to show for my efforts.

I don't remember you doing `m4rie`, I have to update the overlay.

This is with Gentoo g++8.3.1-r2 p4 (in case it matters)

perhaps I must learn/get properly set up to properly report gentoo bugs...

I am fairly sure that's because the dependencies of coinor-cbc haven't been updated. Dependencies haven't been pulled because the ebuild doesn't ask for minimum versions of the dependencies. I'd recommend you update all ebuilds returned by the command `eix -Ic coinor`, all in one emerge command so portage can sort out the dependencies.

`emerge -uD coinor-cbc` will update the dependencies as well. It's an ebuild problem. I didn't notice that new version bounds were necessary.
