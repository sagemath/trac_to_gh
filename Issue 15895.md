# Issue 15895: adapting output of FiniteStateMachine.process and __call__ to Automaton and Transducer

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/16132

Original creator: dkrenn

Original creation time: 2014-04-11 13:37:17

CC:  cheuberg skropf

Keywords: finite state machine, process, output

Currently, there is only `.process` and `.__call__}} in the abstract base class {{{FiniteStateMachine`. The outputs do not depend on the actual type (automaton/transducer). The aim of this ticket is to change this and produce an appropriate output for each type of finite state machine. When using `.__call__` in an automaton this is whether an input was accepted (and not more); a transducer gives the only the produces output.

(Since there is a change in the output, we give a deprecation warning.)

Reviewed this patch, made minor modifications.

Replaced dependency on #15963 by #16128: #16128 is a revision of #15963 (see explanation in #16128 for background) and this patch is actually based on #16128.

Reviewed the above merge with develop, merge is fine, doctests pass.

Replaced two raise E, V by raise E(V) in the spirit of #15990 which had been merged previously.
