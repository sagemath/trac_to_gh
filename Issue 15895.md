Keywords: finite state machine, process, output

Currently, there is only `.process` and `.__call__}} in the abstract base class {{{FiniteStateMachine`. The outputs do not depend on the actual type (automaton/transducer). The aim of this ticket is to change this and produce an appropriate output for each type of finite state machine. When using `.__call__` in an automaton this is whether an input was accepted (and not more); a transducer gives the only the produces output.

(Since there is a change in the output, we give a deprecation warning.)
