# Issue 16894: Improve accuracy of polytopes.regular_polygon()

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: jdemeyer

Original creation time: 2014-10-11 12:35:22

The function `polytopes.regular_polygon()` uses a hard-coded approximation of `pi` (3.14159265359) which has an error of 466 ulp. Moreover, it uses Python `float`s instead of `RR`, which breaks a doctest in #17130.
