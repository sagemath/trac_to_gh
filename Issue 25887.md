Currently, the following does not work:

```
sage: k = GF(2)
sage: K.<x> = FunctionField(k)
sage: R.<u> = K[]
sage: L.<u> = K.extension(u^3-x)
sage: R.<t> = L[]
sage: (t^2+u*t).factor()
NotImplementedError
```

Turns out I have already implemented this a while ago: https://github.com/saraedum/sage/blob/experimental/src/sage/rings/function_field/function_field.py#L1717

I have a feeling that I have created this ticket before but I tried hard and could not find it.
