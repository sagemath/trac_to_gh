The new spkg is here:

  http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/was/patches/genus2reduction-0.3.p4.spkg

I am upstream for this program.  I modified the src/ subdirectory to include the GPL COPYING file, along with an email Liu sent me where he officially GPL'd genus2reduction. 

This change was caused by a request from Karl Meyer who is packaging sage for Fedora. 

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/4743

Looks good to me. One change that was missing was the addition of an SPKG.txt entry which I have added.

Cheers,
