the dual k-schur functions in the Symmetric Function package have a combinatorial expansion in terms of strong k-tableaux.  This ticket will implement the classes as well as methods for manipulating these objects

Mike and I just met and reviewed and discussed the code together. All changes that I requested were incorporated, so I am happy with the code.

Positive review!

I realized that there was an inconsistency with the name of one of the methods and changed content_of_marked_ribbon to content_of_marked_head
