Keywords: pynac, long

Pynac's numeric.cpp file includes the following function definition:

```
void set_from(Type& t, Value& v, long& hash, mpz_t bigint)
{
        if (mpz_fits_sint_p(bigint)) {
                t = LONG;
                v._long = mpz_get_si(bigint);
                hash = (v._long==-1) ? -2 : v._long;
        }
        else {
                t = MPZ;
                mpz_init_set(v._bigint, bigint);
                hash = _mpz_pythonhash(v._bigint);
        }
}
```

This means that if an integer value could fit into a C++ `signed integer`, then it will be stored as a `signed long integer`; otherwise, it will be stored as an `mpz` value.  This is a waste of bits: a `signed long integer` can usually hold much larger values than a `signed integer`. Therefore, in order to use all of the bits of the `signed long integer` variable, this patch changes `mpz_fits_sint_p` to `mpz_fits_slong_p`.

This change may uncover bugs in the pynac code. For example, the bugs of #31585 were previously only seen on 32-bit, but they show up in 64-bit (after changing `2^31` to `2^63`) if the patch here is applied without patches that solve the problems on that ticket:

```
sage: n = 2^63
sage: (2*x).subs(x=-n)
0
sage: abs(x).subs(x=-n)
-9223372036854775808
sage: (-x).subs(x=-n)
-9223372036854775808
sage: a,b,c,d = var("a b c d")
sage: ((a + b + c)^62 * (3*b + d - 5/d)^3).expand().subs(a=0,b=2,c=-1)
d^3 + 18*d^2 + 15439924789694894702685*d - 77199623948474473513425/d + 450/d^2 - 125/d^3 + 36
sage: (-n*x + 1)*x
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(no backtrace available)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unhandled SIGFPE: An unhandled floating point exception occurred.
This probably occurred because a *compiled* module has a bug
in it and is not properly wrapped with sig_on(), sig_off().
Python will now terminate.
```

It therefore seems that this ticket should be merged early in a release cycle, so I am suggesting 9.5 as the milestone.
