Is main.gz really supposed to be on the branch?

The file `build/pkgs/cunningham_tables/read_cunningham_prime_factors.py` starts:

```
+# python2/Sage script used to create the package
+# (needs porting to python3 Sage)
```

Was that done? If so, consider removing the comment -- in a follow-up ticket if it's too late here.

Also, a download url at archive.org scares me a little as brittle.

no, I added this comment -- this script is broken atm, in the sense it doesn't work with Python3-based Sage.

Is there a follow-up ticket for that? Sage 9.2 will be Py3-only.

the script in question is only needed to create the package source; as long as we are happy with what we have, no need to run it, so it can be left as it is for the time being.
