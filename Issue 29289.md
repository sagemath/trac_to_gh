(from #28943:)

on an Ubuntu virtual machine, I happened to have libec-dev installed but not eclib-tools, so there was no mwrank executable. Sage did not detect this and used the system's eclib installation, make succeeded, but then there were naturally doctest failures. I don't know m4 syntax, but it looks like it's checking for headers and libraries, not the presence of mwrank.
