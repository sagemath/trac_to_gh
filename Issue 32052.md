This code has been added to `sage.numerical` as it is similar in format and specificity of use to the existing Gauss-Legendre code. One might consider using these methods in `sage.calculus.integration` at some point (perhaps this should be discussed on sage-devel?)

If this code will be used elsewhere in the library, then of course its inclusion is fine (that was how the Gauss-Legendre routine made it in). Absent a strong use-case, however, perhaps it's at this point better to just let this ticket linger. There are numerical integration routines for tanh-sinh available in sage. There's [mpmath's integration](https://mpmath.org/doc/current/calculus/integration.html) and [PARI/GP](https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/dochtml/html/Sums__products__integrals_and_similar_functions.html#se:intnum). Before we increase the maintenance burden of [SageMath](SageMath) we probably want to have a motivation for why we do that.

Stalled in `needs_review` or `needs_info`; likely won't make it into Sage 9.5.

here patchbot is telling you that doc does not build:

```
