Keywords: TIDES,

Right now the interface to TIDES does a lot of symbolic expresion comparisons, which is very slow. This patch changes those comparisons to the corresponding strings, which is much faster.

As an example, the following problem:


```
sage: from sage.interfaces.tides import genfiles_mintides
sage: f(x,t) = [sin(x*t)+cos(x)/sqrt(1+x^2+log(x)-5*exp(x^2+1))]
sage: %time genfiles_mintides('/dev/null', '/dev/null', f, [1], 0, 10, 10, output='/dev/null')
CPU times: user 9.31 s, sys: 46 ms, total: 9.35 s
Wall time: 9.32 s
```


With the patch is reduced to:

```
sage: from sage.interfaces.tides import genfiles_mintides
sage: f(x,t) = [sin(x*t)+cos(x)/sqrt(1+x^2+log(x)-5*exp(x^2+1))]
sage: %time genfiles_mintides('/dev/null', '/dev/null', f, [1], 0, 10, 10, output='/dev/null')
CPU times: user 838 ms, sys: 24 ms, total: 862 ms
Wall time: 854 ms
```

Looks good to me.
I tested and the code in a quite complex example is the same
