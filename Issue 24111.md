# Issue 24111: Don't initialize _element_constructor in Parent.__call__

Issue created by migration from Trac.

`Parent.__call__` has some logic to set `_element_constructor`. But this isn't the duty of `__call__`, it should already have been set.

I think all parents now call `__init__`. (IIRC, this was previously avoided in some situations to avoid constructing the category for speed reasons, but I believe that is no longer an issue now.) So this case in `__call__` should no longer occur. Green bot => positive review.

While I do think this change goes in the right direction, note that it breaks `ore_algebra` (I'll see if I can fix it), and possibly other external packages.
