This cannot be right, can it?

```
sage: M = matrix([(3,-1,0,0),(1,1,-2,0),(0,0,0,-3)])
sage: B = matrix(QQ,3,1, [0,0,-1])
sage: M.rows()
[(3, -1, 0, 0), (1, 1, -2, 0), (0, 0, 0, -3)]
sage: B.rows()
[(0), (0), (-1)]
sage: M.nrows()
3
sage: B.nrows()
3
sage: M.solve_left(B)
...
ValueError: number of rows of self must equal number of rows of B
```

The author name is now missing (should be in "First Last" format). Also, remove all of your (added) trailing whitespace and break this long line into <80 characters long:

```
        If the number of columns on the left and right hand sides is different it raises the error message 'number of columns                    of self must equal number of columns of B'
```

Actually, I would just remove that line altogether as it doesn't add anything practical to the documentation and you have the examples.

Removed the long sentence completely as tscrim suggested and got rid of the trailing white spaces.

Looks good now (and all tests still pass). Positive review.
