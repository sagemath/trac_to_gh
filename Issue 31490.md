Follow-up from #31718.

This ticket proposes to deprecate `list_of_subsets` (note - no other methods in `sage.manifolds` follow this naming scheme) in favor of a new method `subset_family`, which prints in a more compact way, is hashable, and is sorted by name too.

We also add `superset_family` (previously the set of supersets was not exposed by a method).

We also add `equal_subset_family` - consisting of all subsets that are also supersets (see discussion in #30263).

Removed the last commit; the addition of `open_cover_family` will now happen in #31732 instead.
