It seems that this doctest is intended to illustrate that specifying "gens=" when cponstructing a curve from its label might be ignored when the curve is in the database.  But there is a danger:  the default database contains curves of conductors up to 10000 but does *not* contain their generators.  So this is a test whose output will depend on whether or not the optional extended database is installed, something which we have been trying to avoid.

I hope the authors of #11474 (not me!) will be able to say whether I have got this diagnosis right.

I'm responsible for that doctest.  The unexpected `[(-2 : 3 : 1), (-7/4 : 25/8 : 1), (1 : -1 : 1)]` are the generators found by mwrank, not the ones in the database.  The fact that the same curve is used in an earlier doctest in that file might be the cause; I'll look into it.
