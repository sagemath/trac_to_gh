I've never added a doctest before so this question might be a bit too simple. I've been reading the general conventions about writing tests but I'm not really sure about where should I add it. I thought I would just write it as a comment starting with something like this  

`Test that :trac:27562 is fixed::` 

and then just add the test itself.

Thank you!

Bea

ok, almost good.

* This added piece of doc should not be in the middle of the code, but with the rest of the doc (probably somewhere slightly above the place where you have put it)
