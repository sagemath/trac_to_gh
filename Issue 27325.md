I've never added a doctest before so this question might be a bit too simple. I've been reading the general conventions about writing tests but I'm not really sure about where should I add it. I thought I would just write it as a comment starting with something like this  

`Test that :trac:27562 is fixed::` 

and then just add the test itself.

Thank you!

Bea
