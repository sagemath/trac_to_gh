This should be an easy ticket to fix for a beginner.

As a beginner I'd like to fix this, if no one else's on it, of course. Is that okay?

I've never added a doctest before so this question might be a bit too simple. I've been reading the general conventions about writing tests but I'm not really sure about where should I add it. I thought I would just write it as a comment starting with something like this  

`Test that :trac:27562 is fixed::` 

and then just add the test itself.

Thank you!

Bea

I already got my answer, I'll try to add the doctest asap :-)

ok, almost good.

* This added piece of doc should not be in the middle of the code, but with the rest of the doc (probably somewhere slightly above the place where you have put it)

* There should be an empty line after the line ending with `::`

* The test lines after any `::` should be indented by 4 more spaces

* The correct syntax for the trac role is `:trac:`27562``

Thank you for your corrections!
 
I just changed the doctest, I believe I did everything you suggested so it should be okay by now

Looks better,

* you forgot to remove the "doc in the middle of the code"

* just have one (not two) empty line before and after the new piece of doc

Moving tickets from the Sage 8.8 milestone that have been actively worked on in the last six months to the next release milestone (optimistically).

Minor doctest formatting fixes made. Also made a change to the string formatting of ValueError on line 489 exactly analogous to the ticket.

The removal of ellipses looks strange. Any over traceback in doctests is using `...` 

Maybe they were just wrongly indented ?

Yes, that was an issue. I'll return the ellipses to be in line with other doctests.

I have moved the ellipses to the correct place, and then squashed the commits into a single commit: the result is the new branch.

I am setting to positive review.
