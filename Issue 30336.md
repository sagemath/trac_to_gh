Depending on the results of the experiment in #30547 (full flake8 for skew_tableau.py, as an experiment), we may want to add and document `flake8` as a linter.

I feel like the combination pycodestyle + pyright is superior to flake8 (which is essentially pycodestyle + pyflakes). At least in my tests pyright rightfully complained about things that were not detected by pyflakes. See also #30415.

Thanks for the pointer. Doesn't quite look like a production-ready solution though...

Setting new milestone based on a cursory review of ticket status, priority, and last modification date.
