I am ambivalent about adding #random.  The documentation for rand state says

"Every docstring now has an implicit set_random_seed(0) prepended. Any uses of # random that are based on random numbers under the control of this module should be removed, and the reproducible answers inserted instead."

As the uniformity of the results of coupling from the past depends strongly on the reproducibility of random number sequences based on the seeds, a failure of the doctests may indicate a problem needing investigation  (It could also indicate that someone changed the random number generator).

Otherwise, your changes look fine.
