This can be used for computing traces of Hecke operators acting on spaces of modular forms.  In most cases, other methods are better, but this can still have value in that it can do things that are impossible with modular symbols.    My pari and Magma implementations are here:  http://wstein.org/Tables/hijikata.html

Plan:
  
1. Implement the algorithm and make sure it passes a wide range of tests.  Done.

2. Get coverage to 100% so it can be included in Sage.  

3. Open a new ticket to rewrite key parts using Cython and more intelligent algorithms (in some cases), which should be dramatically faster, since most of the code is simple integer manipulation.
