# Issue 22839: Space alignment problem with Matlab matrices in the console

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/23076

The string representing a Matlab element which contains several lines (e.g. a matrix), when printed in the Sage console, gets distorted. For example: 


```
sage: M = matlab('[8, 12, 19; 7, 3, 2; 12, 4, 23; 8, 1, 1]')
sage: format(M)
'8    12    19\n     7     3     2\n    12     4    23\n     8     1     1'
sage: M
8    12    19
     7     3     2
    12     4    23
     8     1     1
```


This is seemingly handled in `strip_answer` of the `matlab.py` interface.

Tested in Matlab `v.9.0.0.341360 (R2016a)`.
