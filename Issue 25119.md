# Issue 25119: Make python3 print syntax warmi

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/25356

Original creator: @timokau

Original creation time: 2018-05-13 18:13:10

For some reason nix's version of python reports


```
SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'. Did you mean print("invalid print statement")?
```


while sage expects the message without the suggestion:



```
SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'
```


This patch makes sages doctests accept both versions.
