Now I finally have something useful to contribute.

The "Lyapunov-like" matrices/transformations provide a way to generalize the complementarity slackness condition over other cones. Essentially you expand `<x,s> = 0` into a system of equations `<L(x),s> = 0` and hope to solve that. The space of all such transformations turns out to be the Lie algebra of the automorphism group of the cone.

And now that we have `discrete_complementarity_set()`, we can find every Lyapunov-like transformation using some basic linear algebra tricks: `<L(x),s> = 0` if and only if `<L, sx^T> = 0` (trace inner product), so all we have to do is compute an orthogonal complement.

The name `LL()` for the space of all Lyapunov-like transformations appears in 5-10 papers, but isn't very descriptive. If you prefer, I like `lyapunov_like_basis` just as much.

Your use of the term "trivial cone" is confusing - after reading the very first example I thought "Surely any transformation is Lyapunov-like since there is no conditions to worry about!", yet their basis was empty. To me "trivial cone" means "consisting of the origin" and there are multiple trivial cones - one for each lattice, which of course should be distinguished from the point of view of toric geometry. Sometimes, looking at the doc of discrete complementarity set, you seem to mean the same things, while in other places you mean "the only cone in the 0-dimensional space" where indeed the basis of all transformations is empty as there are no transformations at all (or I guess there is one which is both zero and identity or however one wants to interpret it).

The tensor products are integer matrices, but when we convert to long vectors, I think a field is required. I assume the `complement()` algorithm needs a field anyway, and the matrices that pop out can be rational:


```
sage: K = Cone([(-5, -1, 0), (53, -2, 1), (-1, -1, 6)])
sage: K.lyapunov_like_basis()
[
[1 0 0]  [       0        1        0]  [        0         0         1]
[0 1 0]  [ 44/4505 681/4505 -126/901]  [  -15/901    75/901   911/901]
[0 0 1], [ -15/901   75/901  911/901], [   87/901  -435/901 -5464/901]
]
```


I could normalize those after the fact?
