Here is a first draft. Unfortunately I get an error with the current test:



```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')
sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart()
sage: C = M.de_rham_complex()
sage: d0 = C.differential(0); d0
Exception raised:
...
ValueError: Algebra of differentiable scalar fields on the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold M is not in Category of modules over Algebra of differentiable scalar fields on the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold M
```


This is somewhat peculiar. Each algebra should automatically be a module over itself... Should I simply add the category to the scalar field algebra or does that need a broader fix?

I think it would be best to split off the cohomology ring into a separate file.

Do you want to give a special (latex) name to `zero` and `one`?

For the class-level docstring of `DeRahmComologyRing`:

```diff
-Define the de Rham cohomology ring of a de Rham complex.
The de Rham cohomology ring of a de Rham complex.
```


I don't think you should assume that the parents are the same for `cup` (unlike what you can do for `_mul_`).

In your `cohomology()` method, you have both `\left.` and `\right.`. I don't understand the point of this.

The input block to `differential()` is over-indented. Also, remove the full-stop/period.

What do you mean?

> In your `cohomology()` method, you have both `\left.` and `\right.`. I don't understand the point of this.

The point is that `\middle/` has the appropriate size.

If you take the `cup` with something the coerces in (perhaps `2`?) but is not actually an element of the same parent, then it will either fail or could end up with an element that is not actually in the ring. However, for `_mul_`, this can never happen because the coercion framework would make sure both arguments belong to the same parent.

Currently, there is not even a natural coercion implemented. The only coercion that would be admissible is the one from closed differential forms (and everything that is contained in it) into cohomology, but we don't have that subspace implemented. Therefore, it wouldn't even work with `_mul_`.
