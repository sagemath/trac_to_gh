Here is a first draft. Unfortunately I get an error with the current test:



```
sage: M = Manifold(2, 'M')
sage: X.<x,y> = M.chart()
sage: C = M.de_rham_complex()
sage: d0 = C.differential(0); d0
Exception raised:
...
ValueError: Algebra of differentiable scalar fields on the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold M is not in Category of modules over Algebra of differentiable scalar fields on the 2-dimensional differentiable manifold M
```


This is somewhat peculiar. Each algebra should automatically be a module over itself... Should I simply add the category to the scalar field algebra or does that need a broader fix?

I think it would be best to split off the cohomology ring into a separate file.

Do you want to give a special (latex) name to `zero` and `one`?

For the class-level docstring of `DeRahmComologyRing`:

```diff
-Define the de Rham cohomology ring of a de Rham complex.
The de Rham cohomology ring of a de Rham complex.
```


I don't think you should assume that the parents are the same for `cup` (unlike what you can do for `_mul_`).

In your `cohomology()` method, you have both `\left.` and `\right.`. I don't understand the point of this.

The input block to `differential()` is over-indented. Also, remove the full-stop/period.

What do you mean?

The point is that `\middle/` has the appropriate size.

If you take the `cup` with something the coerces in (perhaps `2`?) but is not actually an element of the same parent, then it will either fail or could end up with an element that is not actually in the ring.

> However, it will fail with a much more reasonable message and it will be all setup for when there is a coercion implemented. Most importantly, it will handle the natural coercion from the scalar field into the ring, but `cup` will not. You should have `cup` simply redirect to `*`. This will also make it easier if this ever gets subclassed too.

It will get subclassed. My idea is that a characteristic class becomes a subclass of `DeRhamCohomologyClass` with a dedicated `representative` method.
