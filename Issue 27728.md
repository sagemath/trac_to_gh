or rather tag it with # py2

I have no idea why this does fail only in python3. But anyway, we cannot really do anything with the snub dodecahedron currently.

... have a look at #25097.

This test was removed and replaced by a reasonable test using the backend normaliz.

I would say that such computation over `RDF` should not be encouraged via examples/doctests as the backend normaliz provide reasonably fast computations with algebraic numbers.

`cdd` and python2 and 3 have different behavior. In #27760, I was obtaining several times this kind of warnings in the default case due to approximation errors. When such errors occurred, I simply change the default behavior _not_ to produce such warnings and go for an exact solution.

I would really try to simply avoid making such tests in the future as we know that they are prone to produce such errors and we have a viable faster and reliable alternative (ok, with an optional package...).

All right, sounds good!

I put the present ticket as dependancy in #25097. The ticket is essentially ready and tested, it only gets slowed due to similar conflicts/dependancies, ;) that was the reason of my reserve.
