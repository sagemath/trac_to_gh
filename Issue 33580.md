... as part of the workflow `build.yml`. This is to catch modularization regressions on tickets.

To this end, we add `build/pkgs/sagemath-{objects,categories}/spkg-install` scripts, which build and store wheels (but do not install them!), and add tox environments `python-sagewheels-nopypi` as in `pkg/sagemath-standard/tox.ini`.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/33817
