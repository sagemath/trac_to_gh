... as part of the workflow `build.yml`. This is to catch modularization regressions on tickets.

To this end, we extend `build/pkgs/sagemath-{objects,categories,environment,repl}/spkg-install` scripts so that they build and store wheels in `SAGE_SPKG_WHEELS` (but do not install them!), and then run `tox` on the wheels (unless disabled by setting `SAGE_CHECK=no`).

A new top-level make target `pypi-wheels` runs these scripts for these and other small distribution packages, ensuring that wheels are present even if `configure --enable-editable` is in use.

Another top-level make target `wheels` does the same but also includes `sage_conf` and `sagemath_standard`. This is useful for venv installs and helps with the problem noted in #32913.

We also extend the script `src/bin/sage-update-version` so that it automatically updates the `install-requires.txt` files for our distribution packages.

I removed some white spaces.

Other than that, the code looks good to me as far as I can read (not very far as usual).

The new workflow seems work well in github.

But on my machine (mac), I get
