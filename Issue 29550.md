# Issue 29550: 1 optional internet oeis doctest failing (busy beaver ordering)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/29787

Original creator: slabbe

Original creation time: 2020-06-03 12:18:34

With `SageMath version 9.2.beta0, Release Date: 2020-05-28`

```
sage -t --optional=sage,internet src/sage/databases/oeis.py
```

gives:

```
sage -t --long src/sage/databases/oeis.py

Failed example:
    oeis('beaver', max_results=4, first_result=2)     # optional -- internet
Expected:
    0: A131956: Busy Beaver variation: maximum number of steps for ...
    1: A141475: Number of Turing machines with n states following ...
    2: A131957: Busy Beaver sigma variation: maximum number of 1's ...
    3: A...: ...
Got:
    0: A131956: Busy Beaver variation: maximum number of steps for a 2-state, 2-symbol Turing machine running on a tape which is initialized with the number n in binary and 0's everywhere else. The machine is started at the rightmost bit in the number n.
    1: A141475: Number of Turing machines with n states following the standard formalism of the busy beaver problem where the head of a Turing machine either moves to the right or to the left, but none once halted.
    2: A333479: Busy Beaver for binary lambda calculus: the maximum normal form size of any closed lambda term of size n, or 0 if no closed term of size n exists.
    3: A131957: Busy Beaver sigma variation: maximum number of 1's on the final tape, for a 2-state, 2-symbol Turing machine running on a tape which is initialized with the number n in binary and 0's everywhere else. The machine is started at the rightmost bit in the number n.

oh, damn, these doctests should be marked **random** once and for all...

How about we also include in the test that the word `Beaver` appears and similar for the others?

Here you go

so much energy in so bad doctests..

Thanks. That way it at least it is testing that we are getting the right word in the result. Hopefully this will end this issue.
