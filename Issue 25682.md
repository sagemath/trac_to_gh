`GelfandTsetlinPattern` instances created using `GelfandTsetlinPatterns(...)` with and without the `top_row` argument do not compare properly. E.g.,


```python
sage: GelfandTsetlinPatterns(top_row=(1,))[0]
[This is the Trac macro *1* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#1-macro)
sage: GelfandTsetlinPattern([This is the Trac macro *1* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#1-macro))
[This is the Trac macro *1* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#1-macro)
```


should compare as equal, but:


```python
sage: GelfandTsetlinPatterns(top_row=(1,))[0] == GelfandTsetlinPattern([This is the Trac macro *1* that was inherited from the migration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#1-macro))
False
```


This is likely because the two instances have different parents (`GelfandTsetlinPatternsTopRow` vs `GelfandTsetlinPatterns`).
