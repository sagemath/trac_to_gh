# Issue 25724: Implement Column Bump and Reverse Column Bump for Semistandard Tableaux

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: kdilks

Original creation time: 2018-07-27 19:33:06

Currently, semistandard tableau (or any tableau with weakly increasing rows and strictly increasing columns) only have methods for row bumping and reverse row bumping. They should also be able to do column bumping and reverse column bumping.

Specifically interested in using this to implement cyclage posets (future ticket).

Potentially related to #25070 , except that would run through the entire column bumping/reverse bumping procesure, and we want to only do a single step.

I realized this is for cocyclage, not cyclage, so this might not actually be relevant.
