# Issue 11602: Sage's Singular scripts should use "$@"

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/11774

Original creator: leif

Original creation time: 2011-09-02 18:26:02

Assignee: tbd

Keywords: sd34 spaces parameters

The Singular start-up scripts (`$SAGE_ROOT/local/bin/[Ss]ingular`) created by Sage currently look like this:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
Singular-3-1-1 $*
```

The `$*` has to be changed to `"$`@`"` (including the quotes), to allow spaces within parameters.

They are created by Singular's `spkg-install` (in `create_singular_script()`), so _the spkg_ has to be changed.

This does not seem to me to make sense any longer. Maybe this can be closed ?
