1/CIF(RIF(-1,1),0) results in infinite recursion.

While looking at the code, I also noticed the following underlying function has a memory leak:

```
ComplexIntervalFieldElement.__invert__
```

Can you post some timings? From a quick look at the code, it looks like you are avoiding calls to the multiplication (which should result in a speedup).

I was able to confirm the memory leak:

```
sage: for i in range(1,100000):
....:     I = CIF.gen(0)
....:     _ = ~CIF((-i,-i),0)
....:     if i % 1000 == 0:

Sure, here is an example of what I did:

```
sage: z = CIF(1,2)
sage: %timeit z.__invert__()
The slowest run took 19.07 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.

Just add your real name to the authors field and you can set a positive review.

Also, something I noticed is `RIF` is inconsistent with the others:

```
sage: 1 / CBF((-1,1),(-1,1))
nan + nan*I
sage: 1 / CBF((-1,1),0)
nan
sage: 1 / CBF(0,(-1,1))
nan*I
sage: 1 / RBF((-1,1))
nan
sage: 1 / CIF((-1,1),(-1,1))
[.. NaN ..] + [.. NaN ..]*I
sage: 1 / RIF((-1,1))
[-infinity .. +infinity]
```

However, that (and IMO, the latter two `CBF` inverses are wrong too) is a separate issue that can be handled on a followup with possibly a question on sage-devel about the behavior.

The latter behavior comes from mpfi and is not what I would like or what I would have expected from mpfi: I would argue that whenever an interval contains any value where a function is not defined, the result should be NaN. In particular, I am against mpfi's choice because we have this

```
sage: 0 * (1/RIF(-1,1))
0
```


However when the function is multi-valued (like complex log) I think interval arithmetic should be allowed to choose a lift. So while 

```
sage: CIF(RIF(-1),RIF(-0.0001,0.0001)).argument()
3.142?
```

makes sense to me, **mpfi_atan2** yields NaN (if memory serves correctly) if fed the above real and imaginary part. By the way, sage does not expose **mpfi_atan2**, also see comment 4 of ticket #25340.

I honestly don't understand that part of the mpfi design: if it is so conservative for atan2 why be so relaxed about division.

But all this is a separate issue.
