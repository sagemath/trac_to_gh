A book on the computational aspects of Galois representations associated with modular forms was published last summer: http://www.math.univ-toulouse.fr/~couveig/publi/book.pdf

At http://www.sagenb.org/home/pub/3154/ one can find a talk I gave containing a Sage implementation of this algorithm.

The purpose of this ticket is to polish up and move that implementation to Sage.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/12132
