# Issue 26553: Streamline actions in the coercion model

This ticket does several things:

1. Remove the weird check disallowing an action by subtraction. It's not clear why this was added. This restriction dates back to

    Another pass at the map-caching coercion model.
    
    _lmul_ and _rmul_ are way to permissive, and may recursively call mul itself. Need a better way of detecting actions.
```


2. Directly call `self._action_maps.get` in `bin_op` to avoid a call to `get_action`.

3. Remove the double caching in `Parent._action_hash`. There is no need for the parent to cache actions, since the coercion model already caches everything.

So we do not perform in-place operations on the few elements we have that are mutable (e.g., matrices)? We sure we want to drop future support altogether for this?

There are only very few classes implementing in-place operations (one example is `QuiverRepHom` in `src/sage/quivers/morphism.py`). However, it would not make much sense for the coercion model to handle in-place operations since coercion possibly creates new elements. Suppose that `x *= y` would coerce to a common parent. Then you end up doing `x2 *= y2`, so you lose the in-place effect on `x`.

That is a very good point. If the patchbot comes back green, then we can set a positive review.

I'd like to put this on hold since Jean-Pierre and Nils made some very good comments on https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sage-devel/9HtGnuDnc5I

I reverted some changes related to `_action_hash`: I kept it, but write-only. It keeps a reference alive to the actions found. To indicate that this may be used more generally in the future, I renamed it to `_coercion_references`.

I am not sure I understand the full subtleties and technicalities in what they were saying, but I am willing to set this to a positive review. However, would you like one of them to take a more proper look at this ticket before flipping it to green?

I made some further minor changes related to point 4. In particular, since `_action_hash` is only needed to keep references, there is no point in adding an action to both `_action_list` and `_action_hash`.

LGTM. If Nils or Simon has any other comments that should be addressed, then you can revert this back (although I think this will not get in until 8.6.beta0, so there is some time).
