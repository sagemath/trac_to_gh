This ticket does several things:

1. Remove the weird check disallowing an action by subtraction. It's not clear why this was added. This restriction dates back to

    Another pass at the map-caching coercion model.
    
    _lmul_ and _rmul_ are way to permissive, and may recursively call mul itself. Need a better way of detecting actions.
```


2. Directly call `self._action_maps.get` in `bin_op` to avoid a call to `get_action`.

3. Remove the double caching in `Parent._action_hash`. There is no need for the parent to cache actions, since the coercion model already caches everything.

There are only very few classes implementing in-place operations (one example is `QuiverRepHom` in `src/sage/quivers/morphism.py`). However, it would not make much sense for the coercion model to handle in-place operations since coercion possibly creates new elements. Suppose that `x *= y` would coerce to a common parent.
