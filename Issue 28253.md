In Python 3, underscored numbers like `10_000_000.0` are allowed, but the preparser does not handle them yet, see [this as question](https://ask.sagemath.org/question/47908/sage-is-not-preparsing-python-3-underscored-integers/).

In my understanding of the PEP (confirmed by testing on a ipython3 console), trailing underscores are not allowed, however we currently have:


```
sage: 100_000_
100000
```


Also, perhaps could you show the feature in action with a concrete example, something like:


```
The preparser can handle PEP 515 (see :trac:`28490`)::

    sage: 1_000_000 + 3_000
    1003000

My personal opinion:

- write a simple code with Python 3 in mind only, to avoid cumbersome code, since Python2 will be dropped soon anyway (an i guess nobody using Python 2 will complain that 1000_000 should not be accepted)
- use `# py2` and `# py3` in doctests to make patchbots happy.

Why would you change `123_456` to `123456`? This works perfectly fine

```
sage: preparser(False)
sage: Integer(123_456)
123456
sage: preparser(True)
```

The only problem seems to be that `.0` is too often converted to `.gen(0)`

```
sage: preparse("100_000.0")

I put a branch at `public/28490` which contains (I hope) the correct regexps. I also added more doctests for floating point numbers.

Of course `Integer('1_23')` and `RealNumber('1_1.')` are broken. But this is IMHO a distinct problem.

5 months ago, when the ticket was opened, Python 2 was the default for Sage, and all of these things were completely broken with Python 2. Should this ticket provide support for Python 2? I haven't looked at your changes, so I don't know if they do.

It's not a request anymore, it's been merged into Python. Whose role is it to make sure that valid Python 3 syntax, like `100_000.0`, is interpreted properly in Sage?

Python 2 is supposed to be dropped in sage-9.2. It should be supported for the next 9.1 release.

Agreed. Did you have a look at `public/28490`? It does not touch to the interpreter beyond the update of regexp.

I looked at your branch. It doesn't work with Python 2, for what that's worth:

```
sage: 123_456
  File "<ipython-input-1-d4d70e3ee054>", line 1

```

I also get a few doctest failures with Python 3, but they should be easy to fix.

You can delete `dec_num` since it is redundant.

We need to fix this and add a doctest.

`preparse(100_000.0)` works, but `100_000.0` does not:

```

It **does** work with Python2 as the above `SyntaxError` is the expected behavior

```
$ python2 -c '123_456'
  File "<string>", line 1
    123_456
          ^

I don't see why we would change that in Sage.

Nice! To my mind, this is the end. `RealNumber` should accept this kind of strings as `float` does.

```

It is not the job of the preparser to modify the input string.

With your branch in Python 2, `Integer('1_3')` returns 13 but plain `1_3` raises a `SyntaxError`. Is that what you intended? It's not consistent behavior.
