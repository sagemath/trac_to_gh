# Issue 23850: Endomorphisms ring and automorphism group of finite (additive) abelian groups.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24087

Original creator: sbrandhorst

Original creation time: 2017-10-22 12:33:12

This ticket implements automorphism groups/endomorphism rings of (finite/finitely generated) (additive) abelian groups.
Methods should include:
- generators 
- subgroups / subrings
- it is essentially a matrix group/ring so the implementation can reflect that.
- an action on the elements of the underlying abelian group.

I made one non-trivial change: I removed the ``@`cached_method` from the `automorphism_group()` since the caching is (better) handled by the `UniqueRepresentation`.

The rest of my changes are just some simple cleanup of the doc and code.

If my changes look good, then positive review.

Thank you for the cleanup. The doc did not build due to a missing space. 
I added that and now it builds.

Whoops, mea culpa. Fixed and verified the doc now builds.
