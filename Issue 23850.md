This ticket implements automorphism groups/endomorphism rings of (finite/finitely generated) (additive) abelian groups.
Methods should include:
- generators 
- subgroups / subrings
- it is essentially a matrix group/ring so the implementation can reflect that.
- an action on the elements of the underlying abelian group.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/24087

I made one non-trivial change: I removed the ``@`cached_method` from the `automorphism_group()` since the caching is (better) handled by the `UniqueRepresentation`.

The rest of my changes are just some simple cleanup of the doc and code.

If my changes look good, then positive review.
