Before this ticket, the following would raise an `ArithmeticError` in the sparse case:

```
sage: P.<x,y> = PolynomialRing(SR)
sage: R.<z> = PolynomialRing(P, sparse=False); R
Univariate Polynomial Ring in z over Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Symbolic Ring
sage: (x*z) // x
z
sage: R.<z> = PolynomialRing(P, sparse=True); R
Sparse Univariate Polynomial Ring in z over Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y over Symbolic Ring
sage: (x*z) // x
z
```
