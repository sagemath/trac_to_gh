E.g. `interacts.calculus.definite_integral()` and in general [the interacts library](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/master/src/sage/interacts/library.py) did not make the conversion so lots of naked html results, sort of (printed rather than shown MathJax).

This is closely related to #22636, and maybe should be a prereq for that.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/22644

Oh yes I *very* much understand this, and I hope you are likewise not offended that some are just impossible to get to.

I am also frustrated that I do not have enough time to work on any Sage stuff but the ones I know will cause the most annoyance to other users and no one else will worry about - currently that is the Mac app on Sage 8.0.  This is already broken so although I want to get to it I know it's not likely in the next week.
