# Issue 11878: matrix_integer_dense.LLL: parameters for algorithm NTL:LLL

We have the following lines in matrix_integer_dense.pyx starting at line 2678 (corrected already the wrong `algorithn`, see #12049):

```python
        # FP choice
        if algorithm == 'NTL:LLL':
            if fp == None:
                algorithm = 'NTL:LLL_FP'
            elif fp == 'fp':
                algorithm = 'NTL:LLL_FP'
            elif fp == 'qd':
                algorithm = 'NTL:LLL_QD'
            elif fp == 'xd':
                algorithm = 'NTL:LLL_XD'
            elif fp == 'rr':
                algorithm = 'NTL:LLL_RR'
        elif algorithm == 'fpLLL:heuristic':
        ...
```

Later it is checked the following

```python
       if algorithm == "NTL:LLL":
```

This means, to get algorithm `'NTL:LLL'` one has to set `algorithm='NTL:LLL'` and `fp` neither `None` nor any of `'fp'`, `'qd'`, `'xd'`, `'rr'`. This is not intuitive at all and should not be.

Would it be a suitable solution to keep `'NTL:LLL'` if `fp=None`?

I believe this has been changed sometime between sage-6.4 and sage-8.2rc4


```
3086         if algorithm == 'NTL:LLL':
3087             if fp is None:
3088                 algorithm = 'NTL:LLL'
3089             elif fp == 'fp':
3090                 algorithm = 'NTL:LLL_FP'
3091             elif fp == 'qd':
3092                 algorithm = 'NTL:LLL_QD'
3093             elif fp == 'xd':
3094                 algorithm = 'NTL:LLL_XD'
3095             elif fp == 'rr':
3096                 algorithm = 'NTL:LLL_RR'
```
