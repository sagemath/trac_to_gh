# Issue 19622: Add index of basic matrix functions

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19859

Original creator: jmantysalo

Add an index to `matrix2.py`. Or make a tutorial, or something like that.

(How I think this: Suppose a student starts using Sage at graph theory course and founds http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/graphs/index.html . OK, maybe needs a tutorial or something, but anyways, works. But if the student starts at linear algebra course and â€‹http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/matrices/index.html ... Uh. Same applies to group theory.)

Determined to be invalid/duplicate/wontfix (closing as "wontfix" as a catch-all resolution).
