This failure seems to depend on the CPU where it gets to run. It built correctly on cygwin-minimal at https://github.com/mkoeppe/sage/runs/518106009

Changing status from new to needs_info.

Moving this ticket to 9.4, as it seems unlikely that it will be merged in 9.3, which is in the release candidate stage

Stalled in `needs_review` or `needs_info`; likely won't make it into Sage 9.5.
