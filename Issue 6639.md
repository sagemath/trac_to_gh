I changed the summary to conform to the sage standards. That is, the information about patches should be at the beginning of the summary, in square brackets.  That way, it will show up in the proper reports.

I will review this as soon as I get a chance to test-build the documentation.

Thanks Peter for your work!

While you are at it, could you have a look at 

   http://mupad-combinat.sourceforge.net/doc/en/combinat/lyndonWords.html

And recycle as much of the documentation and tests there and in the related pages (lyndon words from evaluation, from content).
This can be in a further ticket.

Thanks!
                              Nicolas
