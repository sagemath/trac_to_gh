# Issue 13626: scatter_plot and point2d are essentially the same thing

Just as the title says - this is a big duplication of code. The class ScatterPlot needs to go and we need to make `scatter_plot = point2d`.

I've been thinking this for a long time, but I didn't know if some people needed different functionality or something... I think the best plan is to make it an alias for `point2d` but keep the command for those coming from more data-oriented environments, who will be looking first for a command that talks about scatter plots and not think that `point` would be the "right" thing.  That also avoids the whole annoying deprecation process.

I'm cc:ing Jason to see what he thinks (do "owners" get update emails?).

Somewhere, about a year or two ago, I made the case somewhere to someone (I forget who) that we should just have line() and points().  Scatter plot *and* list plot should disappear (list plot should degenerate to either line() or points()).  I came to this conclusion when I was developing the tutorials for the PREP workshop, and made a conscious decision to not use list_plot or scatter_plot.

So I'm glad we agree :).

And yes, owners do get emails...
