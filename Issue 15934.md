Hi Jan - in case you have nothing else to do, there are a few toric-related tickets ready for review ;-)

The worldcup has started! ;-) No, on a more serious note: I'm busy for the next two weeks, but I promise to take a look after that.

I'm not entirely sure what this is needed for, but at least it makes things more consistent. Since the code looks good and works, I'm putting this to positive review.

That's exactly what this is needed for - consistency. My plan is to rewrite faces of `LatticePolytope` in the same fashion as it is done for cones and while I was looking at details I decided to change things here first. Thanks for taking a look!

Sorry Volker, that one obviously came from #16180. I've merged in #16180 and fixed the doctest.
