# Issue 30948: NumberField element method local_height_arch returns wrong values on prec=53

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31185

Original creator: @vpetzel

Original creation time: 2021-01-04 21:45:26

When using prec=53 NumberFieldElement.places(prec=53) will map into RDF instead of RR, but local_height_arch only checks is_RealField from sage.rings.real_mpfr, which in turn only checks if the Field is an instance of RealField_class.

Example:


```
a = NumberField(x**2-2,"a")("a")
a.local_height_arch(0, weighted=True) # 0.3465735902799726547086160607291
a.local_height_arch(0, weighted=True, prec=53) # 0.6931471805599454
```



So one would at least need to change line 3837 in rings/number_field/number_field_element.pyx to check


```
if weighted and not is_RealField(Kv) and not Kv is RDF:
```


but then this is rather specific. I think it should be avoided, as it is firstly a very specific internal function, which might induce errors at any point (such as a change of class of the places function for example), and as it secondly does not really express what we intend to do there: Even if this particular embedding is real, it can be done into a Complex Field as well (like the flag all_complex does).

So I suggest using the much more stable method of testing for


```
if emb.im_gens()[0].imag() == 0:
```
