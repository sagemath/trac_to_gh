Thanks for the link.  I think that ticket is now too bitrotted.  We should consider the ideas from that ticket and apply them (better in separate tickets instead of one "fix everything" ticket).

What is the file `SAGE.txt` referred to in this script? Should it be `SPKG.txt` instead? For example:

By the way, #12579 also modifies sage-spkg; you might take a look at that ticket if you have time.

What do you think of replacing `./spkg-check` with `time ./spkg-check`?

This is pretty minor, but if a package has been installed already, for example, then with the patch, `sage -i pkg` still creates `SAGE_BUILD_DIR`, then quits without doing anything else. It would be nicer if this directory were not created until needed.

I will look at this more later.

My previous comment about creating directories unnecessarily also applies when running `sage -i` with no arguments.

For "Authors", perhaps you could add something like:

```
 - William Stein and others (Sage 4.8 and earlier)
```

after your name.

The header might also include documentation about the options -f, -s, -info.  Actually, I don't think -info is used anywhere, nor is it accessible from the main sage script; should it be deleted altogether (here or on another ticket)?  If we want to keep it, then consider lines 209-213:

```
    echo ""
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo >&2 "No file SPKG.txt in $PKG_NAME"
        exit 1
    fi
```

Won't the test `if [ $? -ne 0]; then` reflect the exit status of the `echo` command?  I think that the `echo` line should be deleted and the test moved inside the previous if block, so it's connected to the tar command.  Or something like that.

The reason I put your name also is because it appears several times in `hg log` of the 4.8 `sage-spkg`.

John, new patch needs review.  I also made some changes to `spkg/bin/sage` in the calls to `sage-spkg`.  I think I took care of all your comments, except for `-info` which I moved to #12606.

This version allows multiple options, so you can do something silly like

```
./sage -i -f -s -f -f -m spkg/optional/mpc-0.9.spkg

The patch to `spkg/bin/sage` needs work: the combination of

```sh
if [ "$1" = '-i' ]; then
   shift
   install "$@"   # used to be    install " " "$@"
fi
```

and (in the install function)

```sh
    if [ $# -le 1 ]; then
        exec sage-spkg
    fi
```

means that `sage -i pkg` just lists the currently installed packages. Maybe this test should say `if [ $# -eq 0 ]`?  Maybe if after processing the flags, there are no arguments left, then you should run `exec sage-spkg`?  For example:

There are probably better ways of doing this.

Otherwise, I think this is looking good.

This is a possible suggestion for another ticket: have a command-line flag for spkg-install which sets `SAGE_CHECK` to be "yes".  That might be more convenient than setting `SAGE_CHECK=yes`, running `sage -i ...`, then unsetting `SAGE_CHECK`.

Fixed, needs review.

I like your idea of a SPKG_CHECK=yes command line option, how about -c for check?  But not on this ticket.

It must be the `spkg-install` file doing that.  With `patch` (the first spkg I tried), there are no errors:
