Run the following fragment twice in the same Sage session.

```
sage: K.<a>=GF(2^6, modulus=x^6 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1)
....: x=a^9
....: y=a^21
....: z=1/x
....: v=vector([1,y,y^2,y^3,y^4,y^5,y^6])
....: S=matrix([[1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,z,z^2,z^3,z^4,z^5,z^6],[1,(z^2),(z^2)^2,(z^2)^3,(z^2)^4,(z^2)^5,(z^2)^6],[1,(z^3),(z^3)^2,(z^3)^3,(z^3)^4,(z^
....: 3)^5,(z^3)^6],[1,(z^4),(z^4)^2,(z^4)^3,(z^4)^4,(z^4)^5,(z^4)^6],[1,(z^5),(z^5)^2,(z^5)^3,(z^5)^4,(z^5)^5,(z^5)^6],[1,(z^6),(z^6)^2,(z^6)^3
....: ,(z^6)^4,(z^6)^5,(z^6)^6]])
....: w=S*v
....: w
```

The 1st run succeeds, the 2nd and later runs produce

```

ValueError: the degree of the modulus does not equal the degree of the field
```


Note that this does not happen if modulus is not given.

perhaps making it imposible to use a symbolic variable to define modulus will do the trick. Indeed, if I do 

```
T.<x>=GF(2)[]
K.<a>=GF(2^6, modulus=x^6 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1)
```

then the error goes away.

Strangely, `x` is the only symbolic variable that is accepted this way.
Trying to use a symbolic variable with a different name does not work

```
sage: var('tt'); K.<a>=GF(2^6, modulus=tt^6 + tt^4 + tt^3 + tt + 1)
...
TypeError: tt is not a variable of Univariate Polynomial Ring in x over Finite Field of size 2 (using GF2X)
```

Does GF2X do something too smart with `x`?

I don't think this is a bug.  On the first run, you're taking advantage of the fact that `x` is predefined as a symbolic variable (and indeed, it's the only such variable).  The constructor for finite fields can take elements of the symbolic ring, though polynomials are better.  On the second, you've redefined `x`.

The error is triggered by just the following lines:

```
K.<a>=GF(2^6, modulus=x^6 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1)
x = a^9
K.<a>=GF(2^6, modulus=x^6 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1)
```


Perhaps a better error message in the case that modulus is a finite field element would be appropriate.

I agree. This ticket could do one or both of the following:

- include a cautionary example in the docstring
  for `FiniteField` (aka `GF`) (I recommend that)

- make the error message more helpful, such as:
  "check that the polynomial variable used in the modulus
  was indeed a polynomial variable, and not redefined
  to be a field element for instance" (maybe not needed
  if the docstring has a cautionary example)

Sage development has entered the release candidate phase for 9.3. Setting a new milestone for this ticket based on a cursory review.
