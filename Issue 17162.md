# Issue 17162: fix coefficients for symbolic series

Issue created by migration from Trac.

There is no SR.function that gets the coefficients of SR.series; rather, `coeffs()` etc give confusing results; `truncate()` must be prepended manually.

```
sage: x=var('x')
sage: s=(1/(1-x)).series(x,6)
sage: s.coeffs()
[This is the Trac macro *x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + Order* that was inherited from the migration called with arguments (x^6) + 1, 0)](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/WikiMacros#x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + Order-macro)
sage: s.coefficient(4)
0
```

Working around with `s.truncate()` is only a fig leaf.

You have introduced lines made of blank symbols in `src/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx`. Please replace them by empty lines. It seems to be the case also on the code introduced for the related ticket #17348. Maybe you could replace all of them in `expression.pyx` at once.

_Note._ With `sed`: `sed -i -e "s/^  *$//" src/sage/symbolic/expression.pyx`.
