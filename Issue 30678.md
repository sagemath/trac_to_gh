Joshua, should only need to do `make build` to test this. Downloading the file should be automatic.

`make build` appears to have downloaded and extracted the files successfully. All the right stuff (OrbitControls and the "fat" line classes) seem to appear in the `three.min.js` file extracted into `local/share/threejs/build` and running a diff on it against the script I built from your repo produces no output, so it looks good.

Of course, the HTML plots produced are still looking for `OrbitControls.js` and/or directing to mrdoob's repo on the CDN, but that's going to be a separate ticket?

The new commit updates the link generated internally, both for online and offline use. I changed the name of the internal function to recognize this. Doctests pass on the two modified files.

The system Jupyter notebook needs to find the local files for our Three.js viewer to work. As far as I know the symbolic link is how that happens. If you have a better idea in mind for letting the notebook know where the files are, then go for it. I'm still not clear on this question.

Hmm... perhaps it would be better to link the offline plots to a specific version.

For example, suppose I generate an offline plot using the template that works for r117. The plot links to `/home/joshua/sage/local/share/threejs/build/three.min.js`. Some time in the future I upgrade [SageMath](SageMath) in-place. (Do normal users do that?) That old plot is now linking to three.js r122 despite the template it was generated from only being guaranteed to work with r117. Suddenly the plot may no longer work.

That's not an issue for the Jupyter notebook since it's a "live" environment and you can always just re-run the cell to get an up-to-date plot. It's also not an issue for the CDN scripts since those are tied to specific versions.

Although even if we fixed this, it'd still be fragile in that moving/deleting [SageMath](SageMath) would also break old plots. To make a fully self-contained and isolated offline plot would probably require including the content of `three.min.js` inline instead of linking, but I imagine that might run afoul of the license.

Yes, that's a typical operation.

Right.  So let's please do a versioned installation scheme to address this issue. Basically, upgrades should not break operation of older things.

> That's not an issue for the Jupyter notebook since it's a "live" environment and you can always just re-run the cell to get an up-to-date plot.


Well, but isn't it an important part of the point of the notebook format that the outputs are also stored?

Again the key use case to consider is to have one ("system") installation of the Jupyter notebook or JupyterLab, which the user uses to access multiple installations of different versions of the Sage kernel.

The use case I am describing uses one system Jupyter installation ("frontend") that the user uses to access several kernels, including several Sage kernels installed in different directories.  The frontend may not come from Sage at all, but we need to find a way so that each of the Sage kernels fully works, and that includes the 3d graphics.

I tried this time inspecting. Without the symlink and with online=False, it works since it looks for the threejs files locally and fails, and then it tries online successfully. I rechecked with the symlink and it finds the local files. 

BTW, with jupyterhub, it uses internet pages, not local ones even with the symlink

Thanks a lot for investigating!

By "locally", do you mean through the notebook webserver?

Thanks.

Sounds like we would need to install files using `jupyter labextension` to support this.

Unfortunately I am not clear as to what you expect of me regarding this. The Sage files have to be somewhere and the notebook needs to now how to find them. If that is already necessary, why won't the notebook know how to find the Three.js file? Are you planning on eliminating `src/sage/ext_data`?

Maybe this should be a separate ticket. This one is really just to upgrade the version with the existing structure already in place.

> Are you planning on eliminating `src/sage/ext_data`?


No. The issue is about `share/jupyter/nbextensions/threejs` and the fact that there will be several unrelated copies of that.

Here is an example.
- Let's say system jupyter is installed in `/usr`, so the notebook server is accessing `/usr/share/jupyter/nbextensions`.  
- Sage-9.x may be installed in `/home/x/sage-9.x/local/` and may need threejs r122.
- Sage-9.y may be installed in `/home/x/sage-9.y/local/` and may need threejs r155.
- Let's say r122 and r155 are mutually incompatible.

As `@`enriqueartal has reported above, our offline threejs graphics needs `/usr/share/jupyter/nbextensions/threejs/`. But the system does not provide it -- it must come from Sage.
If we create a symlink `/usr/share/jupyter/nbextensions/threejs -> /home/x/sage-9.x/local/share/jupyter/nbextensions/threejs`, then Sage 9.x will work with the system jupyter notebook; but Sage 9.y will not.

Do you agree?

So this means that we need a versioned installation scheme. 
The details of this installation scheme is what I am trying to discuss with you, in particular because it is certainly related to that new repository.

Hi Paul, I found a failing doctest in `display_manager.py` due to the CDN URL change. I hope you don't mind, but I took the liberty of pushing a fix for it. I also went ahead and modified it to read from that new `version` file instead of relying on the `REVISION=` stuff, and I also renamed a few more occurrences of "scripts" to "script" as you had done in your commit.

Including the `three.min.js` inline for offline use (whether jupyter or command line) seems like it would clear up this headache for three.js at least. No more local file paths.
