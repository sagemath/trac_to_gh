It looks to me that the "Got" text matches the "Expected" text, so why is this a failure?

I think the issue is that "``...``" expects to match something but does not match the empty line ``<BLANKLINE>``. Note the difference between 
* Linux: will print stack backtrace before "Unhandled SIGABRT", and
* OSX: does not print stack backtrace.

For example, changing

```
sage: print '---'; print Popen(['sage', '-c', cmd], stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE).communicate()[1]  # long time
```

to 

```
sage: print '---'; print 'backtrace:'; print Popen(['sage', '-c', cmd], stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE).communicate()[1]  # long time
```

fixes the doctest on OSX, as now at least ``'backtrace:'`` gets matched by the "``...``".
