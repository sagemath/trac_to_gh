Some updates are needed.

Weird `O_o`

I read the source code again, but the conclusion is the same : the cores method is not meant to be used on DiGraph... I mean : in this situation, it returns the same result as G.cores() on the underlying graph.

I just added another patch that changes this `DiGraph` to a `Graph`, and tests pass afterwards. I do this in another patch so that the first one only moves methods around without modifying them. Thanks for noticing this !!!!

The patch is OK, and it passes successfully tests on the entire graph directory.

However, when looking at the doc, I saw a very small bug that is not due to this patch:

```
    :meth=`~GenericGraph.is_cut_edge` | Returns True if the input edge is a cut-edge or a bridge. 
```

Could you fix this missing ":" after ":meth" in this patch, or is it better to have a dedicated patch?

No you are right, I already forgot many times to fix it somewhere `^^;`

Give me ten seconds `:-P`
