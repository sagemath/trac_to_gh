It seems to work!  At least, things continue compiling. On Cygwin that was always the sign of victory, though :)

Interesting...  (Note the recorded path to the PARI library!)

But we (also) already have `-lpari` on the command line for linking the mwrank Python extension module (which I think by the way shouldn't be necessary either, as it isn't *directly* used IIRC):


```
g++ -bundle -undefined dynamic_lookup -L/Users/leif/Sage/sage-6.2.beta5/local/lib build/temp.macosx-10.6-x86_64-2.7/sage/libs/mwrank/mwrank.o build/temp.macosx-10.6-x86_64-2.7/sage/libs/mwrank/wrap.o -L/Users/leif/Sage/sage-6.2.beta5/local/lib -lcsage -lec -lntl -lpari -lgmp -lgmpxx -lstdc++ -lm -lstdc++ -lntl -o build/lib.macosx-10.6-x86_64-2.7/sage/libs/mwrank/mwrank.so
```


And FWIW, in the build on bsd.math, `libtool` also drops the `-rpath` given to it when linking `libec.dylib` (or, more precisely, `libec.0.dylib`).

I actually have a patch for pari's installname that I made for pari 2.5.0 and it is still in the gentoo and sage-on-gentoo trees, I guess I should try to it merged in pari proper.
[https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/blob/master/sci-mathematics/pari/files/pari-2.5.0-macos.patch](https://github.com/cschwan/sage-on-gentoo/blob/master/sci-mathematics/pari/files/pari-2.5.0-macos.patch)
As for Karl-Dieter's problem we should be able to see if fixing the installname solves his problem without rebuilding flint and eclib.
we can use 

```
install_name_tool -change "oldname" "newname" filename
```

We can alter libflint.dylib and libec.dylib with the appropriate values and see if sage compile.

Yep, but he'd have to rebuild eclib (after changing libflint's [and perhaps libpari's] `install_name`) such that the proper dependency name(s) get(s) recorded in `libec.0.dylib`; I don't think you can change these with `install_name_tool`.




Any idea why `libtool` ignores `-rpath` (on both MacOS X 10.4 and 10.6)?

About libtool, not sure. I always felt rpath was redundant with the install_name mechanism but that's not really an answer to your question.

There are plenty of things you *could* try... :-)

But I think kiwifb and me agree on that you could first try to:

* Restore `module_list.py` (at least remove `flint`, optionally also `pari`) from the "needed" libraries of the libs.mwrank Python extension module -- to test whether it works for *one of* the affected modules (you had to change about five IIRC)

* Make sure libflint's `install_name` is still just `libflint.dylib` (otherwise `install_name_tool` will give an error):

```sh
$ cd $SAGE_ROOT
$ otool -D local/lib/libflint.dylib
local/lib/libflint.dylib:
libflint.dylib
```

* Change the `install_name` (here called "id") to the library's absolute path:

```sh
$ install_name_tool -id `pwd`/local/lib/libflint.dylib local/lib/libflint.dylib
```

* Then either rebuild/reinstall eclib (which should now record libflint's absolute path), or -- simpler -- just change the recorded name (for FLINT) in `libec.0.dylib` manually:

```sh
$ otool -L local/lib/libec.0.dylib  # just to check libflint's name there
local/lib/libec.0.dylib:
	<path to>/sage-6.2.beta5/local/lib/libec.0.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0)
	libflint.dylib (compatibility version 0.0.0, current version 0.0.0)
        ...

$ install_name_tool -change libflint.dylib `pwd`/local/lib/libflint.dylib local/lib/libec.0.dylib  # now really change the name

$ otool -L local/lib/libec.0.dylib  # just to verify it changed
local/lib/libec.0.dylib:
	<path to>/sage-6.2.beta5/local/lib/libec.0.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0)
	<path to>/sage-6.2.beta5/local/lib/libflint.dylib (compatibility version 0.0.0, current version 0.0.0)
        ...

```


* Pretend file modification to trigger the rebuild of the module(s):

```sh
$ touch src/sage/libs/mwrank/mwrank.pyx  # and more if you like

$ ./sage -b  # and now rebuild
```


The linker should now be able to locate `libflint.dylib` referenced by `libec.dylib`.




Optionally, repeat the steps analogously for `pari` (which in contrast is originally listed as a needed lib in `module_list.py`, so you'd have to really remove it rather than restoring the state of vanilla beta4 or beta5); just libpari's original `install_name` is a bit more complicated (with a non-existing temporary path):

```sh
 $ otool -D local/lib/libpari-gmp.dylib 
local/lib/libpari-gmp.dylib:
<path to>/sage-6.2.beta5/local/var/tmp/sage/build/pari-2.5.5b.p1/src/Odarwin-i386/libpari-gmp.dylib
```

(`libpari.dylib` is a symbolic link to `libpari-gmp.dylib`.)

When you change the name (again in `libec.0.dylib`), you have to specify the **full original (invalid) path**:

```sh
$ install_name_tool -change /Users/leif/Sage/sage-6.2.beta5/local/var/tmp/sage/build/pari-2.5.5b.p1/src/Odarwin-i386/libpari-gmp.dylib `pwd`/local/lib/libpari-gmp.dylib local/lib/libec.0.dylib
```

(Just as an example -- note that the invalid path will differ on a PowerPC, and of course your `$SAGE_ROOT`.)

Note that the second line wouldn't work (it's a no-op).

If you want to change the `install_name` of the library *itself* (as opposed to the recorded install names of libraries *it uses*), you have to use the `-id` option of `install_name_tool`, which takes just the *new* name (plus the filename of the library to change of course).

Okay, this does indeed seem to do the trick.  I can't run doctests, though, because sympy isn't built yet.  Weird.

Flint upstream doesn't set anything for install_name and it is straightforward to add it, I'll submit a pull request for that to them this morning hopefully.

Going back to pari :) the install_name problem is all sage's spkg-install fault. Pari's own install target produce a correct dylib but sage does this little interesting bit:

```
    if [ "$UNAME" = "Darwin" ]; then
        # The following is a hack to get the library installed correctly
        # on Mac OS X:
        echo "Applying Mac OS X hack -- deleting and reinstalling libpari.a ..."
        rm -f Odarwin-ppc/*lib*
        $MAKE install-lib-sta
        if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
            echo >&2 "Error reinstalling PARI's static libraries (OS X trick)"
            exit 1
        fi

        cd "`config/objdir`" && cp -f libpari* "$SAGE_LOCAL/lib"
        if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
            echo >&2 "Error copying PARI's libraries (OS X trick)"
            exit 1
        fi
        cd "$CUR"
    fi
```

So we use the copy from the build directory in SAGE_LOCAL/lib. But when when you do "make install" pari actually rebuilds libpari{,-gmp}.dylib in the install location (modulo DESTDIR if it is defined) with the correct install_name. But spkg-install throw all that away and uses a copy without any install_name set.

Unless someone can explain to me what this hack is all about, I think its removal should have a bug of its own on trac.

From my point of view this is fine - [upstream](https://github.com/wbhart/flint2/commits/trunk) does seem to have a couple other changes since the previous release so it seems good to test this on a few other machines just in case there is some problem.   But presumably those problems would also be problems elsewhere.

For FLINT and w.r.t. relocating Sage, the patch would only (effectively) make a difference on MacOS X 10.4.

If relocation is (at least partially) broken on Darwin anyway, the change doesn't make a difference to the others, i.e., it doesn't really worsen the situation.

On Darwin, we have absolute paths in (most of) all other libraries already; fixing that is subject of another ticket I'd say.




Disclaimer:  I don't know at all what the Mac **app** currently does; but if it behaves differently, I'd rather expect it to be *smarter* w.r.t. "relocation".

Ways to go (not excluding each other):

* Putting Sage's library folders into `DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH`; rather a work-around (not to say hack).

* Rewriting all dylibs in `sage-location` (*adjusting* all absolute paths / `install_name`s).  (Raises the question whether `install_name_tool` is available "by default", i.e., at least shipped with something (e.g. XCode?) Sage requires anyway, for ordinary as opposed to development use.  And the lengths of the new filenames might be an issue.)

* Using relative paths in `install_name`s (presumably ``@`loader_path/...`).  This could be done (just) in `sage-location` or some other post-inst hook as well, in the long run (also) changing build scripts (or just settings) and presumably patching a couple of upstream packages.

Huh, that surprises me.  There is one built, anyway, and distributed via the mirrors for 5.13.  I can check that later - it should still work okay.
