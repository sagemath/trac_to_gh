# Issue 13548: Notebook does not start with given directory

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: dkrenn

Original creation time: 2012-11-25 09:16:24

Assignee: jason, mpatel, was

Keywords: notebook directory

Running Sage with

```
sage -notebook directory='test'
```

leads to an error (in 5.4 and 5.4.1). This worked at least in 5.1. It seems that a directory `test.sagenb` is created, but then an error is produced. 

However, it works with

```
sage -notebook directory='test.sagenb'
```

This is solved by #14330, I believe; see [this sagenb pull request](https://github.com/sagemath/sagenb/pull/138).  If someone could just verify that, we would be all set here.

No, if I try `/usr/local/src/sage/sage-5.10.rc1/sage -notebook directory='test1'` I get

```
  File "/usr/local/src/sage/sage-5.10.rc1/devel/sagenb/sagenb/notebook/interact.py", line 157, in <module>
    from sage.misc.cachefunc import cached_method
exceptions.ImportError: No module named cachefunc
```

and

```
  File "/usr/local/src/sage/sage-5.10.rc1/devel/sage-main/sage/misc/prandom.py", line 58, in <module>
    from sage.misc.randstate import current_randstate
ImportError: No module named randstate
```


Looks bizarre...

But are you using sagenb 0.10.6?

Replying to [comment:3 kcrisman]:

oops, indeed, I apparently uninstalled it... Now, with freshly  updated Sage 5.10.rc2 and sagenb 0.10.6, it works.
