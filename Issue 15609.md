I *think* I may have tracked down the reason for this back to SymPy. There, we have


```
>>> from sympy import zeta, gamma
>>> from sympy.abc import x
>>> gamma(x).series(x, x0=0, n=1)
1/x - EulerGamma + O(x)
```


that is, expanding the gamma function at a pole works. However, for the zeta function:


```
>>> zeta(x).series(x, x0=1, n=1)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
sympy.core.function.PoleError: Cannot expand zeta(_x + 1) around 0
```


This could be fixed by implementing `_eval_nseries` directly for `zeta` (which can be found at `local/lib/python/site-packages/sympy/functions/sepecial/zeta_functions.py`) intelligently enough such that the pole at s=1 is handled. Unfortunately, I think there has to be a discussion first how to handle the coefficients in this expansion (cf. http://dlmf.nist.gov/25.2#E4).

This is exactly the output as in sage itself.

The zeta function does not seem to be very popular in that matter. ;-)

Neither with Maxima, which is invoked via `taylor`:

I managed to find a fix for the problem in GiNaC, which should -- more or less -- directly translate into a fix for Pynac, which Sage uses as a substitute for GiNaC.

When using zeta's functional equation http://dlmf.nist.gov/25.4.E2 for the series expansion around `s=1`, then within GiNaC, I obtain the expression now stated in the description.

For a follow-up ticket, it would probably be nice to tell sage that `zetaderiv(0,1)` is equal to `-log(sqrt(2*pi))`, as it simplifies the expansion to the more likeable form 


```
sage: zeta(x).series(x==1, 1)
1*(-1+x)^(-1)+(euler_gamma)+Order(-1+x)
```


Maxima probably has a similar problem like SymPy, GiNaC et al.; I guess we should report the issue there as well?

What do you mean? If it's a patch on top of recent GiNaC it might not be applicable to Pynac.

Oh, sorry -- I did not read the part with the doctest that should demonstrate numerics. 

Do you mean something like

```
sage: zeta(x).series(x==1, 1).coefficient(x, 0).n()
0.577215664901533
```
