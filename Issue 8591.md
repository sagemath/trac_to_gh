Yet another solver, which has been reported to be interesting several times...

It shouldn't be hard to implement as it can be done through Coin's interface, as Cplex and Cbc, so it should mainly consist in a copy of a 15-lines file and a basic update of Cbc's package

Looking at the Gurobi team, it certainly looks interesting!
