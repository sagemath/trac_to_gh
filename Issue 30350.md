Currently, sage imports `ppl` (from `pplpy`) at startup, via `sage.geometry.cone`, `sage.geometry.integral_points`, and `sage.geometry.lattice_polytopes`. 

This should be changed, both
- as preparation for other backends for polyhedral cones (in particular `PyNormaliz`)
- for the modularization of sagelib (#29705).

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30587

I'm looking at this at the moment.

I think one needs to also take case of `Polyhedron_base`, because once it is lazily imported, then it immediately imports all depencies, in particular the stuff from `ppl`.

So if the goal is to have a working sage as good as possible without `ppl`, then this should be touched as well.

(I tested adding a line `from foo import nonsense` into `backend_ppl.py`. Sage is starting all right, but polyhedra are unusable. However, only backend ppl should fail.)

So lazy import appears to be a bit slower.

For `%timeit polytopes.cube()` I went from 411 µs to 417. I don't know if this is acceptable.
So there appears to be a overhead of about 6 µs per call.

Another data point regarding performance: Without this ticket, I am getting
