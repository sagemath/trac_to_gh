Assignee: @kedlaya

Keywords: cyclotomic polynomials, days71

Add a member function to polynomials that returns the product of all irreducible factors which are cyclotomic polynomials.

```
sage: P.<x> = PolynomialRing(ZZ)
sage: pol = (x^4+1)^2*(x^4+2)
sage: pol.cyclotomic_part()
x^8 + 2*x^4 + 1
```

hello,

- please, fill the "Authors" field of the ticket with your full name

- avoid the usage of "self" in the docstring. It can be "this polynomial". As it is a method, `self` is not considered as an argument.

- you should add doctests over the rationals

- what the algorithm should do over non exact rings (like the `RR` and `CC` floating points in Sage)? I guess that you might want to raise an error in that case.

Technically, `self` is an argument of every instance method (otherwise it would be a class method). More importantly, many of the docstrings in this file use `self`, so I don't want to change the prevailing format (at least not in this ticket). The Sage Developer's Guide doesn't seem to express an opinion here.

Yes, raising an error seems like the most useful outcome.

Hi Kiran! It's an argument the method receives, but it's not an argument the user supplies explicitly. I think that's the argument why (some) people prefer to not use `self` in user-facing docstrings, and the method you're proposing is a user-facing one. I think it indeeds makes for a more easily understood docstring if you can reasonably avoid explicitly mentioning `self`.

> More importantly, many of the docstrings in this file use `self`, so I don't want to change the prevailing format

Your observation piqued my interest and a scanned the file. My impression was that "this polynomial" is a tad more common. Some docstrings refer to two polynomials, without being specific about one that is "this".

The thing that struck me was that the use of `self` was largely (but not exclusively) restricted to "dunder", private, and interfacing methods. These are methods that are hard to look up for users and/or that users will have less interest in looking up.

So when we restrict to "user facing" methods, I think the prevailing style quite solidly favours "this polynomial" over "self".

Instead of dividing by the leading coefficient you can use the `monic` method.

```
sage: x = polygen(ZZ)
sage: p = 3*x**2 + 2*x**3 + 5
sage: p.monic()
x^3 + 3/2*x^2 + 5/2

EDIT: this is not a good idea since this method **always** converts the polynomial to a rational one...
