The name of the tarball does not match the version given, so I had to do:

```
mv upstream/gap3-jm01may17.tar.gz gap3-01may17.tar.gz
```

(it should be `jm01may17` instead of `01may17` in `package-version.txt`).
Then the checksum did not match the tarball in the link in the description, so I had to update that. Next problem is that I can no longer create a complex reflection group:

```
sage: G = ReflectionGroup(20)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ImportError                               Traceback (most recent call last)
[snip]
ImportError: the GAP3 package 'chevie' is needed to work with (complex) reflection groups
```
