Why the last commit? Isn't mpmath supposed to be system-independent?

you mean the `abs tol` ? I guess I removed a print that was truncating the numerical value.
Should I instead
* put back a print ?
* replace by the correct numerical value ?

> replace by the correct numerical value ?
Of course.

The `# tol` is stuff is meant for system-dependent doctests. Not for "I am too lazy to write all the digits". Especially for things where it is a _feature_ that they are system-independent.

Let's see what the patchbot says...

Won't the changes to `src/sage/libs/readline.pyx` break the doctest since you replaced `print a,b` by `print(a,b)`.

no, because this is in the code, not in the doc, and we have the future import

I see... so there is really a big difference between changes in the code and in the doctests.

If the bot gives the green light, you can set this to positive_review.

ok, bot has turned green.
