# Issue 14989: cython interface for libgiac: giacpy

Issue created by migration from Trac.

CC:  jondo

Keywords: giac, cython, interface

I have done a sage version of giacpy (a cython interface for the giac library)
 
   . The speed seems similar to giac's one, and I have experienced better interruptions than with the expect interface.

   . The giac spkg is recommended: [http://www.math.jussieu.fr/~han/xcas/sage/giac-1.1.0.spkg](http://www.math.jussieu.fr/~han/xcas/sage/giac-1.1.0.spkg) (cf Trac 12375)

   . I have also experienced good timings with multivariate polynomials gcd, factorisation, and also with the new  implementation in giac of grobner basis (revlex). 

   . Some examples and sage worksheets are available here:  [http://www.math.jussieu.fr/~han/xcas/giacpy/](http://www.math.jussieu.fr/~han/xcas/giacpy/)

I would be interested in a giac interface, because [Maxima lacks solving inequalities](https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/mailman/message/32602283/).

Replying to [comment:4 jondo]:

For small computations like this the text interface already in sage should be enough. The cython interface is much faster and have better interuptions but it is a more dangerous patch.

If you just want to test without patching sage, I have made a standalone version (cf the instructions at the end of this page)

Hi all, I am starting the comments, there something curious I remember, one coercion is much slowler than the other one (it is not the case in pure python).


```
from sage.libs.giac import *
a=libgiac(2)
sage: time l=[ a+1 for i in range(10**5)]
CPU times: user 0.20 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 0.20 s
Wall time: 0.19 s
sage: time l=[ 1+a for i in range(10**5)]
CPU times: user 1.04 s, sys: 0.00 s, total: 1.04 s
Wall time: 1.03 s

```

any idea?

The cython interface has been put in an the optional spkg: giacpy in trac #12375, so this old patch is now duplicate/obsolete
