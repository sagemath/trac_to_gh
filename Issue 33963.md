Right now `./configure && make sphinx` finishes successfully, but the `sphinx` log file says

```
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement importlib-metadata>=4.4; python_version < "3.10" (from sphinx) (from versions: none)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for importlib-metadata>=4.4; python_version < "3.10"
```

We can fix this by adding `importlib_metadata` to the `sphinx/dependencies` file.

`sphinx` builds without `six` and doesn't report any errors, so let's remove that, too.

Thanks! I think we can also remove `six` from a few other dependencies: `cycler`, `prompt_toolkit`, and `traitlets`. But we're far from being able to excise it altogether since lots of other packages require it.
