I propose to treat the unit of the group in a special way. The test is cheap.

This is not very convincing, it seems to be slower than before..

I think that because the identity element is rare, this won't really help speed up many computations because of the overhead of the extra data needed and function calls.

ok, then let us close this as invalid.

Maybe the overloading of `is_one` is still a good idea that could be done in #19870 ?
