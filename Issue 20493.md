`sage_setup.autogen.interpreters` was getting a bit long (over 4000 lines) and it was hard to understand how some of it was organized.  So I split it up into several logical modules.  This seemed to have [some support](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sage-devel/RB4-A-p5pRI/0T8ZtGpzCwAJ).

How exactly I chose to break it up is certainly up for debate, but I thought this was fairly logical to start.  In the `__init__.py` I still import all from all submodules so that the API for the `sage_setup.autogen.interpreters` module is unchanged.

I would like to get some version of this accepted soon, as I have a few tasks to work on in this module and it would be easier (though not necessary) to work on it on top of this change.

Funny, I actually did that at first but then took it out since it wasn't strictly needed.  No problem adding them back in though.

That can be done with a single wildcard like we already do for the PARI stuff:

```
sage/libs/pari/auto_gen.pxi: $(SAGE_LOCAL)/share/pari/pari.desc \
        sage/libs/pari/decl.pxi sage_setup/autogen/pari/*.py
    python -c "from sage_setup.autogen.pari import rebuild; rebuild()"

I agree with Jeroen (comment 23) that these Makefile tricks seem unnecessarily complicated.
Just the list the few files that are there one by one in the Makefile.

By the way, #21480 puts this interpreter source generation business under control of setup.sh. So there would be an option to do these kind of things in Python, rather than in Makefile.

Rebased again, on top of current develop.  That made this ticket much simpler, now that it doesn't require any build system changes.

There's not much to this now other than refactoring and code reformatting--no real substantive changes.  I made sure to incorporate changes to the `interpreters` module that have been made since I last worked on this.

This looks like a good addition and will allow to close #21459 as a temporary but quick solution for Cygwin.

What about the dependency on #20238?
