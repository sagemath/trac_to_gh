# Issue 2436: Canabalize useful glib algorithms

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Assignee: gfurnish

Copy files containing glib algorithms that are useful to an appropriate folder and give them pxi includes for cython.  This is the conclusion of #2270 (namely that making a glib spkg has too many dependencies for things we don't need).

Again: Do not close ticket unless you know what you are doing: At the very minimum mention the ticket this is a duplicate of. And in this case it is a "invalid" since the gliblite.spkg is a different way to accomplish this.

Cheers,
