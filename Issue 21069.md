There was no explanation of what A_i meant. This is the number of codewords of weight i, so we rewrote the documentation to avoid the A_i syntax.

The current documentation calls for smallest integer when it should be largest. Also, no reference to what A-i was, so we rewrote the definition without using A_i.

I tested the method. It works correctly. Also, the documentation compiles well.
