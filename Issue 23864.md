want to be able to compute Katz centrality, use Katz method for link prediction in graphs/networks (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katz_centrality)

Welcome to Sagemath

I have some comments to help you improving the code.

- unify `nonedges_only` and `nonedgesonly`. Actually, #24094 uses `nonedgesonly`. I don't know which is best, but should be the same.
- `Returns the Katz matrix of G with parameter alpha.` -> `Return the Katz matrix of the graph with parameter alpha.`
- only 1 empty line is needed after `INPUT::`
- ``True`` -> ```True```
- `if true, eliminates common neighbors between adjacent vertices`. Could you add that the value for each edge is set to 0 ?
- `the Katz matrix of the graph self with parameter alpha` -> `the Katz matrix of the graph  with parameter alpha`
- `G1 = Graph({1:[2,3], 2:[1,4], 3:[1,4], 4:[2,3]})` -> `G1 = graphs.CycleGraph(4)` ?
- since you don't have `G2`, you could rename `G1` to `G`
- add a space between `*` and the text in `*:meth:`~katz_centrality`` and the line after
- add an empty line after `TESTS::`
- The examples you give in the `TESTS` could be in the examples section. In a TESTS block, we expect examples raising errors, with the empty graph, etc.
- the test `alpha <= 0` should be made before any other computation
- `if nonedges_only == True:` -> `if nonedges_only:`

in method `def katz_centrality(self, alpha):`
- you could add an optional parameter `u` to return the centrality of a specified vertex. For that, add `u=None` and then the return statement becomes something like `if u is None: return K else: return K[u]`
- you must indent the text in 80 columns mode. Some code editors are really helpful to do that without effort
- You return a list. Wouldn't it be better to return a dictionary keyed by vertices ? How to know which value corresponds to a node ?
