Currently there is no way to find the lower and the upper bounds on the variables of an LP. However, this (often crucial!) information is readily available from the backend. Hence the patch attached.

I don't want to access variables via dictionaries, as this is flaky.
E.g. think of that extra variables Gurobi adds on the fly, one can't put hands on them at all.

Yep, but then we would have two ways to do the same thing, with methods that take different arguments. What about changing get_min and get_max so that they accept integers instead ?

All that would need to be added is a type check : if the given value is a MIPVariable type then the old code (one line) is used, and otherwise the backend function is called.

Actually, the only line that this function contains is 

```
return self._backend.variable_lower_bound(self._variables[v])
```

That is : first take the integer corresponding to the variable, then return the value. More or less what you want to do too `:-P`

I pondered this question deeply :â€“) No, it's bad enough that `p.get_max(v[9999999])` will always create `v[9999999]` if it does not exist, instead of throwing `ValueError`, while `p.get_max(9999999)` will throw `ValueError`.

I'd really prefer this two-tier approach, when user-defined variables and solver variables are kept apart interface-wise.

By the way, it also looks strange that `v` doesn't even know its (I)LP. Or can it be in several LPs at the same time?

Yeah, but then again it would mean that we need to have two copies of each command, according to how the data is given...

Actually, do you really need to work with MixedIntegerLinearProgam ? It looks like all you want is to access the backend's methods directly, and this you can do if you just deal with GenericBackend.
What about just working with this, and adding to it what you miss from MixedIntegerLinearProgram ?

> By the way, it also looks strange that `v` doesn't even know its (I)LP. Or can it be in several LPs at the same time?

Well, you can mess up with two instances of MixedIntegerLinearProgram so badly that they would have common variables, and this would work, but that would just be for the show `:-D`

Some time ago I think the variables knew about their LP, but because the LP also knew about the variables it produced a cyclic reference, and Python had to be forced to deallocate the two elements -- I think we removed that not so long ago, while dealing with Cliquer's many memory leaks. Which are fixed in a patch, btw `:-)`

OK, I can move this function into `GenericBackend`.
Would this work for you?

hmm, I thought that one just cannot have `__del__` in these classes, and then they would be garbage-collected just fine...
