# Issue 18308: Some examples to plot() for posets.

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18545

Even after #11284 there are "hidden" useful features on drawing poset. We should add something like coloring elements by their value or for example their rank on poset. Simple example is enought to show that there is more to look for.

And more important, something like


```
P=Poset({1:[2]})
P.show(element_labels={1:2, 2:1}, vertex_colors={"red": P.maximal_elements()})
```


needs a warning.

Frédéric: This is my suggestion to `plot()` of posets. Examples are kind of artificial, but I am sure that there is no good real-life example using every one of possible options.

I also added some keywords, so that now you can say for example `element_shape` instead of `vertex_shape`. There is still some unorthogonal things, but they should be done on graph side. I would except to have `vertex_shapes={'s': [1, 2]}` when we have `vertex_color={'red': [1, 2]}` and so on.

I hope that users can now better see what is available. I think that at least coloring of some elements can be a good thing. Think for example showing elements of Frattini sublattice in red.

This is a rewrite with simpler code, I hope. Also examples are new.

The example is kind of artificial, but I guess there is no real-world example that would show most of the options. Anyways, one could see that double irreducibles are not in the Frattini sublattice and that the Frattini sublattice need not be a connected inside the lattice. So this is almost reasonable example.

I've been meaning to add something to the documentation for poset display options, so I'm glad to see this ticket already exists. 

Is it really worth creating aliases in the code for slightly modified terminology? Especially since in all the literature I've seen where one wants to assign labels to the covering relations in a poset, they are called 'edge labelings'. It would also have implications for ticket 19396 (if I ever get around to it), which is about adding edge labels as an optional part of the poset data structure.

I was thinking about just having text that says "The poset `plot` method passes to the `plot` method for digraphs (link to Digraph display options), where poset elements are vertices, and covering relations are edges.", and then having a few key examples.

The two key examples that I think definitely need to be in here are for displaying order ideals of a poset (done with P.plot(vertex_colors={'blue':order_ideal}), and showing how to use `vertex_labels` to display linear extensions on the Hasse diagram.

> Is it really worth creating aliases in the code for slightly modified terminology? 

I was thinking about #20691 and mirrored this change. This ticket still makes it possible to use `vertex_color` etc, new names are just aliases. (Or overriding aliases to be strict.)

> Especially since in all the literature I've seen where one wants to assign labels to the covering relations in a poset, they are called 'edge labelings'.

Good point. OTOH we already have `cover_relations()` etc. Hmm...

> The two key examples that I think definitely need to be in here are for displaying order ideals of a poset (done with P.plot(vertex_colors={'blue':order_ideal}), and showing how to use `vertex_labels` to display linear extensions on the Hasse diagram.

What about `edge_colors` (or `cover_colors`), what kind of example to do for those? Also an example with more than one additional color would be nice.

(Side question: Are you interested in congruence-related tickets like #22306?)

I got no comments from the devel-list. Let's try to CC Frédéric.

The more I think this, more I come to conclusion that this aliasing is good and natural thing. We already have, say, order on graphs and cardinality for posets. Or 'water vapor' translates to Finnish 'löyly' in sauna and 'höyry' otherwise. That is how language works.

I lost my previous (longer) comment, here is a summary

* be more precise on how to use the dictionaries (say dictionary mapping element to color, for example)

* rather not remove the simple example of element labeling

* there is a False that shoud be typeset with double ````

In my opinion, you should keep somewhere the note explaining that the options of graphs are also available.

You should also keep the explanations about "layout", which is an input and must therefore be documented.

OK, added that.

So is `heights`, but 1) `Posets.PentagonPoset().show(heights={0:[0], 1:[2], 2:[1], 3:[3], 4:[4]})` does not really work as you would guess, and `Posets.PentagonPoset().show(layout='circular')`... well, it works but whoever wants that? IMO it is meaningfull only when the user thinks poset as a Hasse diagram, and then he/she can use `.hasse_diagram()` first.

could you please take the opportunity to correct the typo

```
Plot of the empy poset::
```

that you introduced in a previous ticket ?

Thanks Travis!

...next one should be the poset constructor, I think...
