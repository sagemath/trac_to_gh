This ticket is to write `QQ.some_elements`, which should return an iterable of many. At the moment the standard implementation is used, which gives `[QQ.an_element()]`.

(FYI: `ZZ` already has an extended `some_elements()` gotten from `sage.sets.categories.EnumeratedSet`)

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/19047

I'd change the short description of your `some_elements()` method to

`Return some elements of `\QQ`.`

(just for the sake of consistency; see, e.g. `random_element`).

Other than that: LGTM, the documentation builds and I'm currently testing `make ptestlong`.
