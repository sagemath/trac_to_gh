# Issue 18810: let QQ.some_elements more than one element

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: dkrenn

Original creation time: 2015-08-17 19:21:44

This ticket is to write `QQ.some_elements`, which should return an iterable of many. At the moment the standard implementation is used, which gives `[QQ.an_element()]`.

(FYI: `ZZ` already has an extended `some_elements()` gotten from `sage.sets.categories.EnumeratedSet`)

I'd change the short description of your `some_elements()` method to

`Return some elements of `\QQ`.`

(just for the sake of consistency; see, e.g. `random_element`).

Other than that: LGTM, the documentation builds and I'm currently testing `make ptestlong`.

Thanks! Also, passes `make ptestlong`. Thus: `positive_review`.
