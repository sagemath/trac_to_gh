If we can't do a conversion to `RR` as is, try to see if an element can convert to `QQ` first. In particular, this allows conversion from the universal cyclotomic field.

```
sage: UCF = UniversalCyclotomicField()
sage: RR(UCF(1/2)) # Boom currently
```

Rebased the branch, since it is currently applied and unapplied in #16630 and thus will likely disappear when #16630 is merged. Old branch was public/rings/expand_RR_conversion-16634 .

Warning: branch change and forced push.

On the topic of this ticket: whatever you do, test also `CC` in addition to `RR`.
