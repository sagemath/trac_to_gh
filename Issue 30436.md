As preparation for #30371, the gitignore file is extended to ignore compiled cython files (e.g. *.so) as well as the virtual environments (e.g. src/.venv). Moreover, its recommended to checkin some VS Code config files (which makes it easier for new users to start developing), so I did this. These changes are more or less copied from https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore/api/python,visualstudiocode.

Finally, I've also taken the opportunity to change to comments to a consistent format (simple single line comments).

This vscode configuration does not make sense without #30371. In a normal Sage build, the venv directory is `local/`.

Best to have two separate tickets for two separate issues.

Also, these ones here are not correct because we do have a few *.c and *.cpp files that should not be `.gitignore`d.

```
+# Generated Cython files
+src/sage/**/*.c
+src/sage/**/*.cpp
```

It would be nice if this could be reviewed and merged rather quickly, as it's hard for me to work on other branches right now because of the large number of untracked files (>5k) coming from the editable install.
