With #18563, which changes the status of several optional new-style packages to 'experimental', we now need to display a warning when these scripts are installed.

I first did, then decided against it for the following reason: there is one message for experimental packages (appears twice) and one message for archived packages (appears once). As for old-style packages the two messages follow each other, it seemed weird to have one called from a function and another one given explicitly. Plus It would have meant that the new functions would have to be defined in the middle of unrelated code, somewhere else.

So well, I found it cleaner this way.
