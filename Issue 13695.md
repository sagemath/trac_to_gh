This patch needs some work.   At least you should remove the remaining reference(s?) to `cdd_convert`.  Also, I'm a little surprised that you indented the last two examples by one more - shouldn't they be exactly four spaces from the start of the colon (I mean that column)?

Good point.  But in that case should they just be

```
`tmp_dir`
```

instead of

```
:func:`tmp_dir`
```

or does it just ignore this and not make a link?  I'm surprised it doesn't raise an error in building the doc (or does it?).

Since leif already reviewed the other patches, I guess this means positive review then.

Apart from the changes to `conventions.rst`, this patch is only about touching files for beauty's sake.  Given that #12719 is already rebased to this ticket, unmerging would be unwise. It seems that #12719 (which is a **huge** patch) conflicts with this in only one hunk, for a file which is removed in its totality.

So it's not a total disaster and it's not contradictory to leif's and my idea that these patches only touch rarely-edited files (except `conventions.rst` but that file really needed to be fixed).
