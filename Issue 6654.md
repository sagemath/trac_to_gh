# Issue 6654: [with patch, needs review] new features in group algebra category

Issue created by migration from Trac.

Original creator: vferay

Original creation time: 2009-07-29 13:16:54

Assignee: mhansen

Keywords: group algebra, center

I added features in the category of group algebras (especially linked to the center).

Moreover, the symmetric group algebra now is a parent of this category.

This patch must be applied after Nicolas Thi√©ry's patches on categories (I do not know which one exactly). So please do not use import to test it but apply it with qpush.

Given that the bot is happy, and that I have done my best to check the doc, I give a positive review.
