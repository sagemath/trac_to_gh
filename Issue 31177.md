# Issue 31177: validate input arguments of elimination_ideal

Issue created by migration from https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/31414

Original creator: @mwageringel

Original creation time: 2021-02-17 19:00:20

CC:  @davidayotte

As explained in [ticket:31367#comment:1], this ticket adds a check that all the arguments passed to `elimination_ideal` are actually variables of the ring, to avoid silent problems like this:

```
age: R.<x,y,z> = QQ[]
sage: R.ideal(x-y, z).elimination_ideal([y, R(0)])
Ideal (x - y, z) of Multivariate Polynomial Ring in x, y, z over Rational Field
```

Everything looks good. I ran the doctest and everything passed except for an unrelated test in src/sage/rings/number_field/number_field_ideal.py which also fail on the develop branch (is there a ticket already open for this ?):


```
File "src/sage/rings/number_field/number_field_ideal.py", line 2199, in sage.rings.number_field.number_field_ideal.NumberFieldFractionalIdeal.invertible_residues
Failed example:
    list(K.ideal(8).invertible_residues())[:5]
Expected:
    [1, a - 1, -3*a, -2*a + 3, -a - 1]
Got:
    [1, a + 2, 3*a + 3, -2*a + 3, a]
**********************************************************************
1 item had failures:
   1 of  17 in sage.rings.number_field.number_field_ideal.NumberFieldFractionalIdeal.invertible_residues
    [685 tests, 1 failure, 6.16 s]
```


Note that I tested this on version 9.4.beta4.

Thank you for the review. To avoid a merge conflict, I have rebased onto #29979. Only the last commit is relevant to this ticket.

I cannot reproduce it on my end, but there have been discussions about this problem in [ticket:31443#comment:119] and [ticket:30801#comment:171]. Apparently, it depends on whether Pari comes from the system or not. I could not find a ticket specifically for this problem, though maybe I have missed it.
