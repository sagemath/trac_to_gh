Keywords: symbolic integration, absolute value

Sage ignores the absolute value in the following symbolic integration.

sage: g=abs(sin(x)*cos(x))
sage: g.integrate(0,2*pi)
0

(the right result is 2, the integrand is positive in the interval so the
integral can never be 0! 

sage: version()
'SageMath version 7.6, Release Date: 2017-03-25'

from v.8.0 those abs-integrands can be handled with the Giac interface:


```
sage: g.integrate(0,2*pi, algorithm='giac')
2
```


besides, there are several related tickets in the [symbolic wiki -- integration](https://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/symbolics#Integrationtickets). there is a link to one  Maxima's upstream report in #17511 (should we submit a new upstream report for this one? since they seem to be so related).
