Several of the recommended packages are now available as new-style packages. Update the discussion in SPKG.txt.

(This applies to both polymake 3.0r2 and 3.1, so it is independent of #22513.)

Since there is a `bliss` optional spkg, do you want to still mention that somewhere?

bliss is listed in the `dependencies` file (along with several other packages); I don't think it's necessary to duplicate this information in SPKG.txt
