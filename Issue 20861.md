This patch was originally #16152, but was mistakenly removed in #20927.  This patch is still needed to build PPL in Cygwin (the patch just needed to updated slightly for PPL 1.2).

A better patch would be to modify the autoconf files to not set `PPL_CXX_SUPPORTS_ATTRIBUTE_WEAK` in the first place on Cygwin64--as it is using `__attribute__((weak))` will compile fine, but fails to work properly at link time.  Not sure whether it's worth it though.
