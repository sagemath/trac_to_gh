field is not perfect is a bit misleading: in general there will be no 
separable model. For instance,
    `k(t)(x,y| y^p = tx^p)`,
as a function field over k(t), doesn't have a separable model.

But strictly speaking, it is true: ideally, the method should either give you
a separable model, or state that there is none. But this is not impemented yet.

I am not sure I understand what you are trying to say. My point is that there could be a separable model but we cannot find it yet, e.g., `k(t)(x,y|y^p-t)`, in that case it would raise a NotImplementedError which is better than raising a ValueError saying that `k(t)` must be perfect.
