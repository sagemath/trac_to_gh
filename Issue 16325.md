There should be no `::` after `REFERENCES::`, just one `:`

4 tests are failing in src/sage/rings/function_field/function_field.py
all with the error:

`ImportError: No module named constructor`

I fixed the above import issue.

doctests passed (the failing tests reported by the patchbot seem to be noise)

In ALGORITHM part of the docstring of `separable_model`, 
'Proposition 4.1' should be replaced with 'Proposition 4.8';
this is where the claim we need is explicitly stated.

The pyflakes error is unrelated to this ticket.

Merged in latest develop and fixed the proposition number. Back to positive review.

The error message `NotImplementedError` in case the ground
field is not perfect is a bit misleading: in general there will be no 
separable model. For instance,
    `k(t)(x,y| y^p = tx^p)`,
as a function field over k(t), doesn't have a separable model.

But strictly speaking, it is true: ideally, the method should either give you
a separable model, or state that there is none. But this is not impemented yet.

I am not sure I understand what you are trying to say. My point is that there could be a separable model but we cannot find it yet, e.g., `k(t)(x,y|y^p-t)`, in that case it would raise a NotImplementedError which is better than raising a ValueError saying that `k(t)` must be perfect.

I could add that example to clarify. Should I?


---

Comment by saraedum created at 2018-08-26 10:55:38

I added a doctest to clarify, please review :)

Ok, I wasn't going to insist; anyway, the doctest makes things much clearer.

Please no changes to positively reviewed tickets next time... just open a new one.

Resolution: fixed
